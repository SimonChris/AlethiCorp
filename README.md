"This simulation of a corporate training and remote working website is so real it hurts, from the obtuse, jargon-jangling training exercises to the awkward inter-office social event invitations. The twist is you work as a snitch, surveilling and rumbling (probably) harmless citizens for supposed revolutionary behavior. Can you do the right thing, or will you just nod, smile, and volunteer to bring a spatula to the office potluck?" - The Guardian

"In the web-based game AlethiCorp, you apply for a job at an “information management company” and access a faux employee portal where your job is to read surveillance transcripts and flag suspicious behavior." - Slate

"...the game offers an important critical reading not only of digital capitalism’s ‘structure of feeling’, but of the specific textual strategies that its author employs, in order to convey this reading to the game’s players." - Digra 2017 - Intranet Art: Alethicorp & the Satire of Protocol
