      AlethiCorp has a lot of hidden content that you will have to go off the beaten path to find.
      Here are a couple of hints for things to try:
    </p>

    <p>
      @ViewBag.BearTypeLower. @ViewBag.BearType. @ViewBag.BearTypeCapital! You must be proactive with your bear.
      Bears love proactivity.
    </p>

      A spatula can be used to make delicious crêpes.

      Just because there is no link to a location doesn't mean you can't go there. You can navigate
      the website manually by typing URL's into the address bar. Or use bookmarks to remember locations.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can reset the game at any time, without losing your employment status, by navigating
      to @Html.ActionLink("alethicorp.com/Internal/Reset", "Reset", "Internal"). Using the restart link below
      will require you to reapply for the position.
    </p>

    @if (Request.IsAuthenticated)
    {
      using (Html.BeginForm("LogOff", "Account", FormMethod.Post, new { id = "logoutForm", @class = "navbar-right" }))
      {
        @Html.AntiForgeryToken()
        <p>
          <a href="javascript:document.getElementById('logoutForm').submit()">Log off</a> | @Html.ActionLink("Restart game", "ResetAll", "Internal") |
          <a href="http://www.sichris.com/">Author page</a>
        </p>
      }
    }
