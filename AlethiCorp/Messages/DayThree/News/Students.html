  Recent events have demonstrated that Eurasian universities are, unfortunately, a hotbed
  of subversive activities. Innocent students are regularly led astray by subversive

  Eurasian Association of Students, to provide on-campus counselling for its members.

  Students will be taught to recognize signs of subversive infiltration, and to 
  lead their affected friends back on the right path.
