<p>Good morning, FIRSTNAME.</p>

<p>
  It would appear that the information you flagged has produced lots of new information! Excellent
  work. I couldn't have done it better myself. You really seem to have an instinct for identifying
  the important pieces of information!
</p>
<p>
  I am reminded of a quote by one of my favourite authors, G.K. Chesterton:
  "The days of idealism and superstition are over. We live in a time of science and hard common
  sense, and it has now been definitely proved that in any game where two are playing IF ONE DOES
  NOT WIN THE OTHER WILL."
</p>
<p>
  In this game, it's us versus the subversives, and if we don't win, they will destroy everything
  that our glorious civilisation has built. It's easy to be tempted to let things slide, but
  always remember that if we don't win, they will. You seem to have the right instinct for 
  winning, so keep up the good work!
</p>
<p>
  As you may have already learned, the investigation is being upgraded, so we will both
  be reporting to Salvinu Manduca from now on. I am sure he will be as impressed with your
  work as I have been.
</p>
