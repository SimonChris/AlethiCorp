<p>Good morning, FIRSTNAME.</p>

<p>
  It would appear that you haven't found any information of use to Information Acquisition.
  Now, it's possible that there genuinely wasn't any useful information available, but
  I doubt it. When I perused the reports, I noticed several suspicious looking pieces
  of information, which now appear to be missing. Did you really think those reports
  were completely useless? I think you need to work on improving your instincts.
</p>
<p>
  Consider this quote by one of my favourite authors, G.K. Chesterton:
  "The days of idealism and superstition are over. We live in a time of science and hard common
  sense, and it has now been definitely proved that in any game where two are playing IF ONE DOES
  NOT WIN THE OTHER WILL."
</p>
<p>
  In this game, it's us versus the subversives, and if we don't win, they will destroy everything
  that our glorious civilisation has built. I really hope you haven't been tempted to let things slide.
  Deleting reports, in particular, should be done with care, as it prevents other consultants from 
  noticing things you may have missed. Always remember that if we don't win, they will. If you work 
  on improving your instinct for winning, you may have a successful career ahead of you at AlethiCorp.
</p>
<p>
  As you may have already learned, the investigation is being upgraded, so we will both
  be reporting to Salvinu Manduca from now on. I am sure he will have even more important
  lessons to teach you!
</p>
