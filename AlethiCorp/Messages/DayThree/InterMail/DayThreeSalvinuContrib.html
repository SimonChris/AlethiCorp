<p>Hello there, FIRSTNAME</p>
<p>
    I am Salvinu Manduca, and I guess you will be reporting to me from now on? Apparently, me being
    here in the UK is much more synergistic than me staying in France. Far be it from me to question the
    wisdom of our superiors. Just call me Sal!
</p>
<p>
    Bene told me what you brought to the potluck. That sounds delicious! You simply must give me the recipe
    some day. In return, I can tell you some of the stuff I've learned from my years in France.
</p>
<p>
    In France they have this thing called Soupe à L’oignon, which I'm sure you'll find amazing!
    It's basically soupified bread with a thick golden crust that is. to. die. for. 
</p>
<p>
    You layer buttered baguette toasts with grated cheese, sautéed onions and tomate purée, and
    then gently pour in salted water. By the time the soupy substance has been simmered and baked, it has
    turned into a kind of sweet bread pudding with a thick crust. I'll tell you more some other time.
</p>
<p>
    Anyway, I understand you're currently looking into a subversive author? Ah, those cases are classic.
    My first case involved an author who turned out to be distributing propaganda for a terrorist
    organisation. They operated out of a bakery, which made these perfect chocolate éclairs with
    proper chocolate cream, not vanilla custard like you see way too often in England.
</p>
<p>
  Never forget that the pen is mightier than the sword! There is room for much evil
  behind the unassuming eyes of the author.
</p>
<p>
  I haven't had time to get up to date with the case yet, but I'm sure Miss Shào has some more detailed
  information for you. I'll take the reins properly tomorrow!
