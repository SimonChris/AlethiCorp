<p>Good morning, FIRSTNAME.</p>

<p>
  It would appear that the information you flagged has produced some more information! Good job, but
  I think there is room for improvement. Skimming the reports, I noticed several suspicious looking
  pieces of information, who now appear to be missing. Did you really think those reports
  were completely useless? I may be wrong of course, but you should work on improving your instincts.
</p>
<p>
  I am reminded of a quote by one of my favourite authors, G.K. Chesterton:
  "The days of idealism and superstition are over. We live in a time of science and hard common
  sense, and it has now been definitely proved that in any game where two are playing IF ONE DOES
  NOT WIN THE OTHER WILL."
</p>
<p>
  In this game, it's us versus the subversives, and if we don't win, they will destroy everything
  that our glorious civilisation has built. It's easy to be tempted to let things slide, but
  always remember that if we don't win, they will. Deleting reports, in particular, should
  be done with care, as it prevents other consultants from noticing things you may have missed.
  If you work on improving your instinct
  for winning, I'm sure you will have a great career ahead of you at AlethiCorp.
</p>
<p>
  As you may have already learned, the investigation is being upgraded, so we will both
  be reporting to Salvinu Manduca from now on. I am sure he will have even more important
  lessons to teach you!
