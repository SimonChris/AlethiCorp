<p>Hi, FIRSTNAME</p>
<p>
  I noticed you didn't make it to the onboarding event. You really need to start making these things a priority.
  It's okay to skip the occasional potluck, but training events are important. You even missed the corporate
  ethics course, which is one of the most important parts of the onboarding! What are you going to do if someone 
  asks you to make an ethical decision?
</p>
<p>
  Immanuel Kant taught us that it is important to obey authority, so that your actions will follow a consistent
  general rule. He even demonstrated that it would be wrong to lie to the police, if they want to know
  where your friend is hiding. Please try to keep that in mind. I will send you the ethics guidelines, so
  you can study them at your leisure.
</p>
<p>
  Now that we got that out of the way, you should definitely come to the team club night tonight! We all
  go to a club together and have fun! It's a great way to get to know your colleagues in a more informal
  environment :).
</p>

  Traditionally, everyone signs up to buy a round of some kind of drink for the rest of the team. I look
  forward to seeing what you come up with :).
