<p>Hi, FIRSTNAME</p>
<p>
  It was great to see you at the onboarding event! I noticed you brought a cheerful mood and a sunny disposition, just
  like I told you :). It's great to see that you're paying attention.
</p>
<p>
  Everyone was impressed with your enthusiasm at the Ethics course! The Ethics course is one of the most important parts
  of the onboarding, and you seem to have a great knack for it :).
  I hope you will remember the lessons we learned:
</p>
<p>
  Immanuel Kant taught us that it is important to obey authority, so that your actions will follow a consistent
  general rule. He even demonstrated that it would be wrong to lie to the police, if they want to know
  where your friend is hiding. Always keep that in mind, and you will have a great career at AlethiCorp :).
</p>
<p>
  Now that we got that out of the way, I hope to see you at the team club night tonight! We all
  go to a club together, and have fun! It's a great way to get to know your colleagues in a more informal
  environment :).
</p>
<p>
  Traditionally, everyone signs up to buy a round of some kind of drink for the rest of the team. I look
  forward to seeing what you come up with :).
