  Hi, FIRSTNAME.
</p>
<p>
  I am glad that you have decided to take the time to write me. This shows that you're dedicated and determined
  to do the best possible job, while simultaneously getting to know your colleagues.
  Keep that attitude, and you will have a great career ahead of you!
</p>
<p>
  I am also glad that you enjoy my trains! Trains make for great metaphors because they keep following
  the tracks, never deviating from the path to success. Remember, the tracks were put down by
  people vastly more experienced than you, so by following them, you are standing on the
  shoulders of giants! Giants who are also railroad workers.
</p>
<p>
  Keep chugging along, and you will go far!
