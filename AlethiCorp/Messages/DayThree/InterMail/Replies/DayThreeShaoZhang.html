<p>Hi FIRSTNAME</p>

<p>
  That's really cool! I didn't know you were into Chinese literature. We will have to talk about that some day :).
  You are coming to the team club night, right? You can tell me more then.
</p>

<p>
  As for now, I'm afraid I'm way too busy to talk literature at the moment. You should focus on analysing your reports, and
  we will both have more time to relax later.
