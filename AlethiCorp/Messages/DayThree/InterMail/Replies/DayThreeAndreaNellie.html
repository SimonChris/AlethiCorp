<p>Oh, hi there.</p>

<p>
  So, you think you know more about Nellie Bly than I? I don't think so! If you really know so much, it should be no problem
  for you to answer this simple question: How did Nellie Bly react when she first met Emma Goldman?
</p>
<p>
  If I don't hear from you again, I will assume that you've recognized your inferiority, and crawled back into whatever hole you came from.

<p>"I had looked forward so eagerly to leaving the horrible place, yet when my release came and I knew that God's sunlight 
  was to be free for me again, there was a certain pain in leaving." - Nellie Bly</p>
