<p>Hi FIRSTNAME</p>

<p>
  It's good to hear from you. The fact that you've taken the initiative to write this mail means
  that you value our partnership and want us to learn from each other.
</p>

<p>
  However, I'm afraid I'm way too busy to talk right now. You're coming to the team club night, right?
  You can tell me more then :).
