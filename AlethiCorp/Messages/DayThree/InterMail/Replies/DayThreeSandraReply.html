  Hi, FIRSTNAME.
</p>
<p>
  I am glad that you have decided to take the time to write me. This shows that you're dedicated, and determined
  to do the best possible job, while simultanously getting to know your colleagues.
  Keep that attitude, and you will have a great career ahead of you!
</p>
<p>
  However, I'm afraid I'm way too busy to answer mails all the time. Futhermore, I'm no longer your direct
  superior. If you have something you want to discuss, you should notify Miss Sháo or Mr. Manduca.
  If they feel it's important, they will let me know!
</p>
<p>
  Keep up the good work!
