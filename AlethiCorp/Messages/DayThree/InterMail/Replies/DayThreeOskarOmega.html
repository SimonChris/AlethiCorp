<p>Holy shit, thanks for bringing this to my attention!</p>
<p>
  Most reports I get are just people being paranoid about random website malfunctions, but you seem to have stumbled
  upon a genuine IAM conspiracy for once!
</p>
<p>
  The important thing now is to keep cool, and not let them know that we're on to them. I could block them from the site, but
  that would mean losing out on a golden opportunity to advance both our careers. You need to play along and
  make them believe that you're on their side. Do whatever they tell you to do, unless it's something that might cause
  genuine damage. If they ask you to do something dangerous, just let me know, and I'll handle it.

<p>
  IAM operatives always work in pairs, with an experienced "Omega" mentoring a less experienced "Alpha". You will probably
  have contact with both of them, but pay special attention to the "Omega". He/She is bound to be the most dangerous.

  I hope you are up for this. Good luck!
