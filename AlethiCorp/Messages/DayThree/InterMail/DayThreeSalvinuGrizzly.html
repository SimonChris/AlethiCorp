<p>Hello there, FIRSTNAME</p>
<p>
  I am Salvinu Manduca, but just call me Sal! I guess you will be reporting to me from now on? Apparently, me being
  here in the UK is much more synergistic than me staying in France. Far be it from me to question the
  wisdom of our superiors. 
</p>
<p>
  Bene told me you brought a bear to the potluck! At first, I thought he had to be talking
  about some exotic dish, but apparently it was a real live one! I wish I could have been there.
</p>
<p>
  You know you're supposed to bring food to a potluck, right? If you don't know how to cook, I can
  hook you up with some recipes I've learned during my time in France.
</p>
<p>
  Here is one your bear might enjoy: Boeuf Bourguignon. It's basically a red wine beef stew, and
  it has the great advantage of being even better on the second day! You just let it cool
  on your countertop, and refrigerate overnight. Heat and serve when needed. Normally, I
  would recommend serving it with potatoes, but bears don't eat potatoes, do they?
</p>
<p>
  Anyway, I understand you're currently looking into a subversive author? Ah, those cases are classic.
  My first case involved an author who turned out to be distributing propaganda for a terrorist
  organisation. They operated out of a bakery, which made these perfect chocolate éclairs with
  proper chocolate cream, not vanilla custard like you see way too often in England.
</p>
<p>
  Never forget that the pen is mightier than the sword! There is room for much evil
  behind the unassuming eyes of the author. Don't let your bear maul him, though!
  That just wouldn't be fair.
</p>
<p>
  I haven't had time to get up to date with the case yet, but I'm sure Miss Shào has some more detailed
  information for you. I'll take the reins properly tomorrow!
