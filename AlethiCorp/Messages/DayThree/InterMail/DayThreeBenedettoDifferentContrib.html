<p>Hi, FIRSTNAME</p>
<p>
  It was great to see you at the onboarding event! You really didn't need to bring anything, though. It's nice
  of you to think of your colleagues, but didn't I tell you only to bring a cheerful mood and a sunny
  disposition? You need to start paying attention to what I'm saying.
</p>

  Try to remember what you learned at the Ethics course:
  Immanuel Kant taught us that it is important to obey authority, so that your actions will follow a consistent
  general rule. He even demonstrated that it would be wrong to lie to the police, if they want to know
  where your friend is hiding. Always keep that in mind, and you will have a great career at AlethiCorp :).
</p>
<p>
  Now that we got that out of the way, I hope to see you at the team club night tonight! We all
  go to a club together, and have fun! It's a great way to get to know your colleagues in a more informal
  environment :)
</p>

  Traditionally, everyone signs up to buy a round of some kind of drink for the rest of the team. I look
  forward to seeing what you come up with :)
