<p>Good morning, FIRSTNAME</p>
<p>
  I am pleased to see that you're performing well under the tutelage of Miss Sháo. Vita tells me
  that you've found several suspicious pieces of information, whose investigation has resulted
  in the retrieval of even more useful information! This is great news. Always remember
  that the ultimate goal of information management is to produce more information.
</p>
<p>
  This is why it's always a good idea to pair fresh consultants with more experienced colleagues.
  It's a good thing the investigation was upgraded, so you have been blessed with this opportunity
  to grow. Your partnership with Miss Sháo reminds me of this train:

<p>
  Just like the engine is responsible for pulling the wagon, so the experienced mentoring of Miss Sháo
  is pulling you forwards towards greater results.
</p>
<p>
  Speaking of greater experience, I have some good news for you! Since the investigation is now
  involving potential corruption of the media, it's being upgraded to grade C! Both you and Miss Sháo will
  henceforth report to Salvinu Manduca. Mr. Manduca is joining us from France, as part of the new synergy
  initiative, which I'm sure you have heard of. His advanced experience will afford the both of 
  you even more opportunities to learn and advance your careers!
