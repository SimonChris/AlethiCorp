<p>Good morning, FIRSTNAME</p>
<p>
  I spoke to Vita, and he says that you didn't manage to flag any interesting information
  yesterday. I am sorry to hear that your partnership with Miss Sháo has not been more 
  successful. Please keep in mind that the ultimate goal of information management is
  to produce more information. Try to flag things that are likely to lead investigators
  towards useful discoveries.
</p>
<p>
  I know Miss Sháo very well, and she is a highly competent consultant, so I can only assume that
  you are not paying attention to her tutelage. Please consider this train:

<p>
  Pay attention to both the wagon and the engine. Do you notice any difference? That's
  right, the wagon is not moving on its own but needs the engine to move it forward. When
  you don't listen to your superiors, you are like a wagon trying to move without an engine.
  Please let Miss Sháo be your engine from now on.
</p>
<p>
  Luckily, I have some good news for you! Since the investigation is now
  involving potential corruption of the media, it is being upgraded to grade C! Both you and Miss Sháo will
  henceforth report to Salvinu Manduca. Mr. Manduca is joining us from France, as part of the new synergy
  initiative, which I'm sure you have heard of. His advanced experience will afford the both of
  you even more opportunities to learn and advance your careers!
