<p>Hello there, FIRSTNAME</p>
<p>
  I am Salvinu Manduca, and I guess you will be reporting to me from now on? Apparently, the UK
  is a much more synergistic place for me than France. Far be it from me to question the
  wisdom of our superiors. You can call me Sal!
</p>
<p>
  Bene told me that you brought a spatula to the potluck, and nothing else! That's hilarious.
  I mean, you're expected to cook something at a potluck, but I like your style. No one has 
  time for all those dishes anyway, right? Next time, you should probably bring something, though.
</p>
<p>
  If you like spatulas, I can teach you how to make a proper crêpe. I've spent the last several
  years in France, as I'm sure you have heard. A crêpe is basically a very thin wheat pancake
  that's ubiquitous in France. In many regions of France you can't throw a rock without
  eating a crêpe.
</p>
<p>
  Start by putting a trace of butter on the surface of a hot pan, and then pour thin liquid
  wheat flour batter onto the pan. This is where your spatula comes in: Use the spatula to distribute the
  batter evenly across the pan. If you have a sweet tooth, serve it with whipped
  cream and strawberry sauce, and curl the crêpe to form a tube.
</p>
<p>
  Most people associate crêpes with dessert, but you can also make savoury crêpes
  for lunch or dinner. For savoury crêpes, you should use buckwheat instead of
  wheat flour. You can then add various fillings, such as meat products, cheese, ham
  or eggs.
</p>
<p>
  As you can hear, you can do pretty much anything with a crêpe.
</p>
<p>
  Anyway, I understand you're currently looking into a subversive author? That's a classic!
  My first case involved an author who turned out to be distributing propaganda for a terrorist
  organisation. They operated out of a bakery, which made these perfect chocolate éclairs with
  proper chocolate cream, not vanilla custard like you see way too often in England. They didn't have
  any crêpes, though.
</p>
<p>
  Never forget that the pen is mightier than the sword! There is room for much evil
  behind the unassuming eyes of the author.
</p>
<p>
  I haven't had time to get up to date with the case yet, but I'm sure Miss Shào has some more detailed
  information for you. I'll take the reins properly tomorrow!
