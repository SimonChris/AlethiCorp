<p>Oh, FIRSTNAME, you're a rascal!</p>
<p>
  I told you not to bring your bear to the onboarding event, yet there it was! I don't think anyone saw that coming.
  It was definitely the most exciting onboarding event I have attended. Don't worry, I'm not mad at you :).
  At least no one will ever forget their onboarding!
</p>
<p>
  You really shouldn't bring it to the next event, though. I'm serious this time. Remember what you learned at the Ethics
  course, during the onboarding: Immanuel Kant taught us that it is important to obey authority, so that your actions will follow a consistent
  general rule. He even demonstrated that it would be wrong to lie to the police, if they want to know
  where your friend is hiding. Please try to keep that in mind.

  Now that we got that out of the way, you should definitely come to the team club night tonight! We all
  go to a club together, and have fun! It's a great way to get to know your colleagues in a more informal
  environment :).
</p>
<p>
  Traditionally, everyone signs up to buy a round of some kind of drink for the rest of the team. I look
  forward to seeing what you come up with :). Remember, you can't drink a bear, so you will have to 
  think of something else to contribute.
