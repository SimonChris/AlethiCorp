<p>Hello there, FIRSTNAME</p>
<p>
  I am Salvinu Manduca, and I guess you will be reporting to me from now on? Apparently, the UK
  is a much more synergistic place for me than France. Far be it from me to question the
  wisdom of our superiors. You can call me Sal!
</p>
<p>
  Bene told me that you didn't show up for the potluck. That's too bad, but don't worry. 
  You will have plenty of opportunities to socialize with your colleagues in the future.
</p>
<p>
  I just hope you weren't intimidated by the thought of having to cook something.
  If you don't know much about cooking, I can teach you some of the stuff I've learned during my stay
  in France. In France they have this thing called Soupe à L’oignon, which I'm sure you'll find amazing!
  It's basically soupified bread with a thick golden crust that is. to. die. for.
</p>
<p>
  You layer buttered baguette toasts with grated cheese, sautéed onions and tomate purée, and
  then gently pour in salted water. By the time the soupy substance has been simmered and baked, it has
  turned into a kind of sweet bread pudding with a thick crust. I'll tell you more some other time.
</p>
<p>
  Anyway, I understand you're currently looking into a subversive author? What a classic!
  My first case involved an author who turned out to be distributing propaganda for a terrorist
  organisation. They operated out of a bakery, which made these wonderful chocolate éclairs with
  proper chocolate cream, not vanilla custard like you see way too often in England.
</p>
<p>
  Never forget that the pen is mightier than the sword! There is room for much evil
  behind the unassuming eyes of the author.
</p>
<p>
  I haven't had time to get up to date with the case yet, but I'm sure Miss Shào has some more detailed
  information for you. I'll take the reins properly tomorrow!
