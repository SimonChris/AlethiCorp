<p>Holy shit, FIRSTNAME</p>
<p>
  It was great to see you yesterday! I think this is the first time anyone has ever brought a trained bear to an
  onboarding event! People will be talking about this for a loooong time. You must tell me more about your hobby
  some day. Don't worry, I'm not mad at you :). At least no one will ever forget their onboarding!
</p>
<p>
  I hope you will keep showing up for the social events, but don't feel obligated to do something
  big every time. The important thing is that we get to know each other!
</p>
<p>
  You really shouldn't bring it to the next event, though. Remember what you learned at the Ethics
  course, during the onboarding: Immanuel Kant taught us that it is important to obey authority, so that your actions will follow a consistent
  general rule. He even demonstrated that it would be wrong to lie to the police, if they want to know
  where your friend is hiding. Please try to keep that in mind.
</p>
<p>
  Now that we got that out of the way, you should definitely come to the team club night tonight! We all
  go to a club together, and have fun! It's a great way to get to know your colleagues in a more informal
  environment :).
</p>
<p>
  Traditionally, everyone signs up to buy a round of some kind of drink for the rest of the team. I look
  forward to seeing what you come up with :). Remember, you can't drink a bear, so you will have to 
  think of something else to contribute.
