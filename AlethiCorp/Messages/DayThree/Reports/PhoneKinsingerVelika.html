<p><b>Cédric:</b> Cédric, here.</p>
<p><b>Velika:</b> Hello, Kinsey. How are you doing?</p>
<p><b>Cédric:</b> Okay, under the circumstances. Did you get my draft?</p>
<p>
  <b>Velika:</b> Oh, yes! I like the style, but it's a bit thin. It needs more bite. How are your
  progress with the students?
</p>
<p>
  <b>Cédric:</b> Well, I've met with the student group I told you about earlier. They're definitely
  trying to come up with original ideas, but I'm afraid they're not very good at it. They've
  managed to write a pamphlet consisting almost entirely of she gewara quotes.
</p>
<p><b>Velika:</b> She ge <i>who</i> ra?</p>
<p>
  <b>Cédric:</b> He is this famous revolutionary that was popular in the 20th century. They must
  have dug up some old books from the library and felt inspired.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Velika:</b> Is he related to Nelli Blue, or any of those other historical persons you're always
  going on about?
</p>
<p>
  <b>Cédric:</b> Eh, no. You do realize that "history" isn't some kind of island where everybody
  knows each other, right?
</p>
<p>
  <b>Velika:</b> It's a good thing I don't care either way! I'm sure you can give them some pointers on their
  writing, and you will *unintelligible* in no time. Anything else?
</p>
<p>
  <b>Cédric:</b> Well, one of them is dating a guy who wrote a book that's maybe critical of modern
  society, or something? I haven't had time to check it out yet.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Velika:</b> Fantastic! Sounds like you're making progress. I am sure you will write a great
  article. Later.
</p>
