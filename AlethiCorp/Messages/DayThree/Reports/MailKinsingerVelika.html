  Good morning, Cédric.
</p>
<p>
  How are you doing at Cambridge? Absolutely nothing is happening over here, so we're
  dying for some content for the new edition. Have you found any juicy students yet?
</p>

  Well, I guess it depends on what you mean by "juicy"... Most people here have about as many
  original ideas as a cardboard cutout of Jayson Blair. However, I have discovered evidence
  that a few students have started a group to discuss political ideas.
</p>
<p>
  I spoke to one of the members, and she denied that they were anything more than
  a normal study group, but I'm pretty sure whe was just trying to throw me off the track.
  I've found out where they meet, so I'll probably drop in the next time.

<p>
  Excellent!
</p>
<p>
  Let me know what you find out. Don't be afraid to prod them a bit, to get them to open up.
  I am sure they have plenty of interesting stuff to say, if you'll just be a bit persistent.
</p>

  Sure, I just don't want to be asking any leading questions. We do want genuine ideas here right?
  Are you sure this whole thing is a good idea? Students can be pretty naive, and I wouldn't
  want to get them in trouble due to a few ill-conceived remarks. Maybe it's best to let them
  have some privacy until they've grown up?
</p>

<p><b>From: Velika Dožić</b></p>
<p><b>To: Cédric Kinsinger</b></p>
<p><b>Subject: Oh, Cédric</b></p>
<p>
  Of course we are looking for a genuine ideas! Why must you always twist my words so?
  Just try to get them to open up a bit, that's all I'm saying.
</p>
<p>
  Oh, and of course it's a good idea to hear what young people today have to say. Haven't you read
  that book I lent you about the open society and its enemies? Obviously, the greatest enemy of
  an open society is the idea that people should keep their ideas to themselves.
  A free exchange of ideas and opinions is vital to a well-functioning democracy, such as ours.
</p>
<p>
  Besides, if they truly do believe in bombing the government, or something stupid like that, then
  it's in their own best interest for someone to investigate, and get them back on the right track.
</p>

<p>
  Right, the book. I've been meaning to get around to it...
</p>
<p>
  I guess you're right. Allowing these students to express themselves is in everyones best interest.
  I'll write again when I have something.
</p>
