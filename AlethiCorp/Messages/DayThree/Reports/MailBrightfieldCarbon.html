  Hi, Pat!
</p>
<p>
  How are you doing? I've been shopping my novel around and have gotten some great feedback.
  I think I'm going to write a second edition and see if I can catch the interest of a bigger
  publishing house.
</p>
<p>
  How are things with your study group? Is it better than the old one?

  Hi, Honey!
</p>
<p>
  I'm sorry I've been so busy the last couple of days. I promise I'll make it up to you soon :).
  Maybe we can go out this weekend?
</p>
<p>
  My new study group is definitely better than the old one! Much more interesting as well.
  We don't just do homework; we also discuss social and political issues and try to spread
  awareness of the problems facing the modern information society.
</p>
<p>
  You should come to a meeting some day! I'm sure they'll love hearing about your book.
  We are working on a pamphlet ourselves, and we could use some feedback too :).

  That sounds great! I'll try to make it to one of your meetings. If nothing else, I can give
  you some copies of my book, so you can hand them out :).

  We'll figure something out :). Btw, I almost forgot: You won't believe what happened at our last meeting:
  Cédric Kinsinger showed up! The journalist, you know. I have no idea how Al managed to
  pull it off, but there he was. He is going to write a story about our ideas.
</p>
<p>
  I completely forgot to tell him about your book, but you should definitely try to
  get him to take a look at it. Maybe he will mention it in his article!

  That's amazing! I used to read his literary reviews all the time. Even a short mention in one
  of his articles would do wonders for my attempts to get the publishing houses to take
  me seriously. I'll see if I can make it to your next meeting :)
