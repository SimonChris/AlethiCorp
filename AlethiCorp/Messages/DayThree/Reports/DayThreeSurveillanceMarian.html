  Agent asked subject to go see a movie. Subject said yes! Agent and subject went
  to the theatre later that day, and saw "Jurassic Park: Lost and Found."<a href="#note">*</a>
  It was great! I can't believe that dinosaur ate Ian Malcolm! Subject put arm
  around Agent during exciting climax.
<p>
  After the movie, Agent and subject went to a nearby restaurant and had
  Italian food<a href="#note1">**</a>. Agent procured a high-quality bottle
  of wine, to get subject to open up, and let down his guard<a href="#note2">***</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Agent and subject had a stimulating conversation about a variety of topics.
  Subject is very charming! Subject did not reveal any compromising information, but
  did express sympathy for subversive figures. "Peter Kropotkin rules!" exclaimed
  subject.
</p>
<p>
  After dinner, Agent and subject went back to subject's flat. The next morning
  breakfast was ordered and eaten in bed<a href="#note3">****</a>. Subject
  expressed an interest in visiting Paris.
</p>
<p>
  It is the opinion of this Agent that such a trip would be an excellent opportunity
  to catch the subject with his guard down. Subject has repeatedly expressed
  sympathy for subversive views, and is almost certain to have contact
  with subversive groups.

<p>
  Further funding is necessary to pursue this avenue of investigation.
