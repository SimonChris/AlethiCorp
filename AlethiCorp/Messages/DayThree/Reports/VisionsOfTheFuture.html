  In 1880 The Pittsburgh Dispatch published a column titled "What Girls Are Good For". In the column, the author
  argued that women should stick to domestic activities, and that the working woman was a "monstrosity".
  Shortly afterwards the paper received a scathing rebuttal from an author identifying herself only
  as "Lonely Orphan Girl".
</p>

<p>
  The author turned out to be Elizabeth Jane Cochrane, later known under her pen name, "Nellie Bly."
  When the editor of the Dispatch offered her a job, little could he have known that this
  unassuming girl would pioneer a new form of investigative journalism.
</p>

<p>
  Unfortunately, the Pittsburgh Dispatch soon relegated Nellie to the women's pages, and in 1887 she left to
  work for the New York World. It was while working for the World that Bly
  went undercover at a women's lunatic asylum, to investigate the brutal conditions at the facility.
  Her report, Ten Days in a Mad-House, made her famous.
</p>

<p>In 1888, Nellie Bly travelled around the world in 72 days, easily beating Phileas Fogg's fictitious record.</p>

<p>
  In 1893, Bly visited a jail cell in New York City. Here she became the first person to properly
  interview Emma Goldman. In the interview, Bly refuted the common view of Goldman as a
  "property-destroying, capitalist-killing, riot-promoting agitator" with "a red flag in one
  hand, a burning torch in the other; both feet constantly off of the ground and 'murder!' continually
  upon her lips." Instead, she described Goldman as "the modern Joan of Arc."
</p>

<p>
  And that's just the tip of the iceberg. Throughout her career, Bly pioneered the fields of investigative
  and undercover journalism. Never content to simply write what she was told, she insisted on being present
  as the events were happening.
</p>

<p>
  Unfortunately, Nellie Bly has been dead for 200 years, AND IT SHOWS! Journalists nowadays seem content
  to write insipid "he said, she said" reports, hardly ever doing any actual investigative journalism.
</p>

<p>
  Even Cédric Kinsinger does not seem immune to this affliction, if this puff piece is to be believed. What
  happened to you, Cédric? The Iberostar report showed genuine promise. I mean, it was pretty mediocre by Nellie Bly
  standards, but at least you went outside and had some fresh air.
</p>

<p>
  This article, however, epitomizes everything wrong with the modern media. Not only is it a
  "the children are our future" piece, but it doesn't even include any remotely interesting
  opinions from actual students! Granted, the author does a remarkable job of obscuring this fact
  by wrapping random interview snippets in impenetrable clouds of clichés, but the article remains
  a vacuous waste of time.
</p>

<p>
  As the article contains no actual opinions, it can hardly be considered subversive.
  However, it might be a good idea to keep an eye on Mr. Kinsinger, in case he flushes out
  some genuine subversives. I wouldn't count on it, though. Emma Goldman is not coming back.
