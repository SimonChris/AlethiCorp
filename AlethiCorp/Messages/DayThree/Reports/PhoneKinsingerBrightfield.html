  <b>Martin:</b> Hello, Mr. Kinsinger. This is Martin Brightfield. It's such a great honour to finally
  have an opportunity to speak to you. I used to read your literary reviews all the time.
</p>
<p><b>Cédric:</b> Who are you? Where did you get this number?</p>
<p><b>Martin:</b> I'm Martin, Pat's bf. She said you gave her your card at the meeting.</p>
<p><b>Cédric:</b> Please don't say abbreviations out loud.</p>
<p><b>Martin</b> Sorry? </p>
<p>
  <b>Cédric:</b> Never mind. Yeah, I think Miss Carbon mentioned you. Sorry for sounding so paranoid. I have been
  getting a lot of weird phone calls and messages lately. What can I do for you?
</p>
<p>
  <b>Martin:</b> I don't know if Pat mentioned it, but I have recently published a science fiction novel, with
  a lot of social criticism. I think it would be a perfect fit to your article. I can get you a copy, if
  you would like to check it out.

  <b>Cédric:</b> I don't see why not. It's not like I'm exactly drowning in material here. You're not a student
  are you?
</p>
<p><b>Martin</b> No, I drive a mail lorry. </p>
<p><b>Cédric:</b> Oh, well, as long as you're dating one, I guess I can sell it to my editor.</p>
<p><b>Martin</b> Thank you so much! I can't tell you how much this means to me! </p>
<p><b>Cédric:</b> You are welcome.</p>
