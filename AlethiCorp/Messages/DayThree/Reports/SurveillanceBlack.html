  Phone call was traced to a room at the Cambridge University Arms Hotel. Subject
  was checked in under the name "Philip Black."
  A search of the room revealed no clues to the identity or whereabouts of the
  subject.
</p>
<p>
  The hotel concierge described the subject as about 180 cm tall and of medium build.
  The concierge had not been able to get a good look at the subject's face due to the fact
  that he was wearing a hoodie and a cap. He remembered finding the subject
  suspicious, as he was obviously trying to hide something.
</p>
<p>
  The concierge also informed me of the existence of a safe in the subject's room, and
  I managed to convince him to produce the key. The safe contained a disposable cell
  phone and a notebook. The cell phone appeared to have been cleansed of useful data.
</p>
<p>
  The notebook was written in a cypher, which I was unable to decode. It did however
  contain a stylized picture of a burning bush on the inside of the front cover.
  Subject is almost certainly an IAM operative.
</p>
<p>
  I waited around in the hotel for the rest of the day, in case the subject should decide
  to come back. To avoid arousing suspicion, I had dinner at the hotel
  restaurant. Dinner was pea and broad bean risotto, followed by corn fed chicken, with
  chocolate and cherry trifle for dessert<a href="#note">*</a>.
</p>
<p>
  After dinner, I had a few dry martinis with the concierge, in case he might remember
  something<a href="#note1">**</a>. He didn't.
</p>
<p>
  Subject had not returned at 10 pm. The Hotel should probably be kept under surveillance.
  I'm sure some Grade A dork can handle that.
