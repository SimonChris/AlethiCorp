  I have spoken with Cédric Kinsinger. He is in place at Cambridge, and ready to commence
  with the operation. He is making contact with the students, and will attempt to identify
  potential converts to our cause. Is everything ready on your side?

  Excellent. I knew subverting a journalist would be invaluable. Everyone will think
  he is just looking for a story. We must work on expanding our influence with the fourth
  estate. This will be key to spreading our ideas among the impressionable youth.
</p>

<p>
  Everything is ready, but give Kinsinger a few days to find converts among the students.
  We will need all the allies we can get, if the operation is to proceed smoothly. Do not
  proceed until fdfdsfssf42rewrfds3.

  Understood. One more thing: I have hko24507 dasa3e341sdasdrr33 surveillance operation
  currently in progress at or near Cambridge. There is a non-zero probability that my position
  may have been compromised. Should I 4hiigt492

<p>
  Yes, relocate to the IAM safe house, as previously agreed. The operation is too important to take any
  chances.

<p>I will do so immediately. Should I also tell Kinsinger a34errsgdfæpolkhjghfd</p>

<p>
  On the contrary, let Kinsinger tell everyone about the mysterious calls and mails he has received.
  This will increase his plausible deniability, should the operation be compromised.

  Brilliant! It is clear why you are the Omega, and not I. I will do as instructed, and make
  contact once I have reached the safe house.
