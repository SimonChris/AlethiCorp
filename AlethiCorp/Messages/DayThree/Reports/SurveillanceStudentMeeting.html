<p>Present: Cédric Kinsinger, Alyona Artemieva, REDACTED, Silva Carpenter, John Blue, REDACTED and Patricia Carbon.</p>
<p>
  <b>Alyona Artemieva</b>: Good evening, everyone. It's great to see so many people here tonight. Now,
  if only I could find my gavel...
</p>
<p>
  <b>Silva Carpenter</b>: Don't you keep it in the drawer?
</p>
<p>
  <b>Alyona</b>: Yeah, but it isn't there anymore. Why would anyone want to steal
  a gavel? Oh, what the hell. *Claps hands*. The meeting is open!
</p>
<p>*Applause*</>
<p>
  <b>Alyona</b>: Unfortunately, Alex couldn't make it tonight. He is training for a triathlon, or something.
  However, we have two new faces with us! Everyone, say hello to REDACTED and REDACTED.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Patricia Carbon</b>: Hello, both of you! It's great to see new people so soon. This is only my second meeting.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Silva</b>: Yeah, it's good to see new faces.
</p>
<p>
  <b>John Blue</b>: Friendship is born at that moment when one man says to another...
</p>
<p>
  <b>Alyona</b>: Awesome! How about you introduce yourself?
</p>
<p>
  <b>REDACTED</b>: Hi, everyone! I'm REDACTED, and I'm a REDACTED.
</p>
<p>
  <b>REDACTED</b>: And I'm REDACTED. I study at REDACTED. I'm really excited to be here!
</p>
<p>
  <b>John Blue</b>: You have beautiful eyes. Are they real?
</p>
<p>
  <b>REDACTED</b>: What? Is that supposed to be a compliment?
</p>
<p>
  <b>John Blue</b>: Sorry, never mind...
</p>
<p>
  <b>Silva</b>: I don't mean to sound negative, but is it a good idea for the group to be growing so fast?
  We are supposed to be a small group of close friends.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Alyona</b>: You igneous geologist are all so suspicious! Don't worry about it. I've known REDACTED for
  years and REDACTED vouched for REDACTED. Growing membership just means our ideas are beginning
  to take hold. Speaking of that, I've got a suprise tonight. Everyone, meet Cédric Kinsinger!
</p>
<p>
  <b>Cédric Kinsinger</b>: Good evening, everyone. Good to see you again, Miss Carpenter.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Silva</b>: But I thought... Never mind.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Alyona</b>: To answer everyone's question: Yes, Cédric Kinsinger is the man who wrote the
  Iberostar report. I spoke to him yesterday, and he is very interested in our ideas. This is
  a great opportunity to get more exposure.
</p>
<p>
  <b>John</b>: Holy shit, I love your literary reviews!
</p>
<p>
  <b>Cédric</b>: Thank, you! Unfortunately, my editor hasn't been very interested in those lately.
  I'm currently writing an article about the students of today, and your visions for society.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Silva</b>: And you hope that by understanding our minds you can understand the future?
</p>
<p>
  <b>John</b>: Haha, your writing is not quite on the same level as Mr. Kinsinger's.
</p>
<p>
  <b>REDACTED</b>: Haha.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Cédric</b>: Don't be so harsh on Miss Carpenter. I've had far more time to practice than her.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Alyona</b>: I think we should show Mr. Kinsinger our pamphlet. Obviously, it's a work in
  progress, but I hope you will it interesting.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Cédric</b>: I'm sure I will, Miss Artemieva. I will be happy to give you some pointers on how
  to improve your writing.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Alyona</b>: That would be amazing! We could give you co-writing credit.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Cédric</b>: Uh, I'm not sure...
</p>
<p>
  <b>Patricia Carbon</b>: It's gone! The crate is gone. Someone must have taken it.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Alyona</b>: What? Oh, that's just great. First my gavel, and now this? I refuse
  to believe that someone just swiped the crate spontaneously. That thing weighs a ton.
</p>
<p>
  <b>REDACTED</b>: We should go look for it. Maybe it has just been moved.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Alyona</b>: I suppose it can't hurt to take a look around. Sorry, Mr. Kinsinger.
  I can print you a copy later, if we don't find the crate.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Cédric</b>: Don't worry about it.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Note</b>: Agents inserted the crate into a nearby room during the meeting.
  The janitor was instructed to tell the students that he had moved it.
  Department assets report that the students do not appear suspicious.
</p>
<p>
  The location of the gavel remains unknown.
