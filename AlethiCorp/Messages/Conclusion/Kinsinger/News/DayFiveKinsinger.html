  After a week of hard work involving several departments, an important AlethiCorp investigation
  has reached a shocking conclusion. The investigation involved subversive elements connected to
  the social milieu around Cambridge and has revealed that Cédric Kinsinger, the famous
  journalist, was connected to both terrorist student groups, as well as IAM, the
  notorious subversive hacker collective.

  "The investigation turned out to be about something far bigger than we first suspected," says Sandra
  Silvern, head of the personal information team at the UK branch. "The whole thing started when
  it was brought to our attention that a local young author had recently published a highly subversive work.
  This is not illegal in itself, of course, but raised suspicions that he might be connected
  to more millitant groups."
</p>
<p>
  "In collaboration with Information Acquisition, our consultants soon uncovered a subversive conspiracy.
  The author turned out to be connected to subversive student groups, who were not only
  attempting to subvert their fellow students, but also planning outright acts of terror."
</p>
<p>
  "Our agents should be commended for their bravery," says Vitaly Vedenin, head of Information Acquisition.
  "At great risk to their personal safety, department assets managed to infiltrate
  these subversive student groups and gather information on their terrorist plans."
</p>
<p>
  "But that was only the beginning," continues Sandra Silvern. "To our great surprise, these
  groups turned out to be connected to the famous journalist Cédric Kinsinger, who was
  helping them spread their subversive ideas, and attended the meetings where they
  planned their terrorist activities."

  "I would also like to give a shout-out to the excellent consultants in the personal information team",
  says Sandra Silvern. "Without experienced employees such as Sháo Jingfei and Salvinu Manduca,
  Mr. Kinsinger might have escaped justice indefinitely."
</p>
<p>
  "This is a day of triumph", says CEO Alex DuMaurier, speaking to a group of approved
  media representatives. "And it also confirms the importance of the work we
  are doing here at AlethiCorp. Were it not for our information management efforts, subversives
  such as Mr. Kinsinger would be free to pursue their activities, to the detriment
  of decent citizens."
</p>
<p>
  "Ever since the Iberostar report, there have been suspicions that Mr. Kinsinger might have subversive sympathies,
  but were it not for our efforts, he might never have been exposed for what he really is. Our citizens can now 
  rest assured that the integrity of the fourth estate has been restored."
</p>
<p>
  "However, we must remember that Mr. Kinsinger and his accomplices are misguided souls, who 
  should be pitied, not hated.  We are working with the Larkhill Resettlement Council to resettle Mr. Kinsinger
  to a high-security location, where he can live his life, without being a danger to ordinary citizens.
  Let us hope that he will one day find a measure of peace."
