<p>Congratulations, FIRSTNAME!</p>
<p>
  You did very well, considering this was your first assignment. We've caught ourselves
  some juicy subversives, and proven the necessity of the work we are doing :).
</p>
<p>
  We'll have to find time to meet up, and exchange recipes some day soon. Now, considering
  your fondness for spatulas, I think I have just the recipe for you!

  Remember how I told you that crêpes can be so much more than dessert? This is your chance to take advantage of this fact!
  Procure some butter and buckwheat flour, and you will cooking up delicious crêpes for everyone in the company in no time!
  I am sure this will make you lots of friends among your colleagues :).
</p>
<p>
  Just take whatever other foodstuff you can find in the kitchen, and use it for fillings! For special occasions, you
  may be able to convince the staff to fetch some extra ingredients for you. I will put in a good word.
  Enjoy!
