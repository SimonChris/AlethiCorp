<p>Congratulations, FIRSTNAME!</p>
<p>
  You have done an exceptional job, especially considering this was your first assignment. 
  We've caught ourselves some dangerous subversives, and proven the necessity of the work 
  we are doing :).
</p>
<p>
  We'll have to find time to meet up, and exchange recipes some day soon. For now, here
  is a great cake recipe I was thinking we could use to celebrate
  our mutual success: Chocolate mousse cake!
</p>
<p>
  You preheat the oven to 220°C, and line a cake pan with baking paper. Melt chocolate,
  golden syrup and butter in a bowl in a saucepan over simmering water, and set
  it aside to cool.
</p>
<p>
  Now put eggs and sugar in a bowl, and beat for 10 minutes until thick and pale. Fold
  in the flour, and the chocolate mixture until combined. Pour the mixture into the
  cake pan and bake for 12 minutes. After removing it from the oven, run a knife
  around the edge of the cake. Remove the collar from the pan and put the cake
  in the fridge for 1 hour.
</p>
<p>
  While the cake is cooling, dissolve 2 tablespoons of instant coffee in 1 tablespoon of boiling water, and
  let it cool. Beat mascarpone, coffee and sugar together in a bowl until stiff.
  Brush leaves with melted chocolate, and peal off the leaf when cool.
</p>
<p>
  Now, you just need to slice the cake, and serve it with coffee mascarpone, a chocolate
  leaf, and a scoop of sorbet ice cream. I'll show you everything when we meet :).
