  As you may have heard, Sandra Silvern is being promoted to grade E. I will be taking
  over as manager of the personal information team.

  I look forward to working with you. You have done excellent work lately. You caught us some
  really juicy subversives this time, and I'm sure your work in the future will be even more
  fantastic! I actually worked with Kinsinger in the past, you know. All that time I was 
  working with a dangerous terrorist, without suspecting a thing!

  I'm sorry you weren't mentioned in the press statement, but that's how these things go. The people
  on top always get the credit. Don't worry, we all recognize the immense value of your
  contribution. Without your analysis and recommendations, we might never have caught
  Mr. Kinsinger. Imagine how much a damage a person like that could have done if
  he hadn't been caught in time.

  In recognition of your success, you will be promoted to grade B. I have given you
  access to the myCareer section of the website. When you have finished reading
  your mail, you can start planning your future career. I am sure you will
  do an amazing job!
