<p>
  Due to the excellent work the team has done lately, I have been promoted to grade E!
</p>
<p>
  Unfortunately, this means I will no longer be managing the personal information team.
  I encourage you to make your new manager feel welcome, and to continue the
  excellent work you have all been doing so far.
</p>

<p>
  In recognition of your hard work, I give you this train. Like the train, you have all stayed on the tracks
  to success, carrying the cargo of chutzpah. If you can avoid going off the rails in the future,
  I am sure you will all have great careers ahead of you.
