  Congratulations on your success. You've handled yourself very well.
  Who would have thought that Cédric Kinsinger would turn out to be a terrorist?

  You really should have informed me that you were being contacted by IAM operatives, though.
  That's kinda important, you know, and I don't have time to sift through everyone's mails
  every single day.

  Oh well, everything turned out all right, and we'll catch the hackers some other day.
  I'll let it slide this time. Just let me know if they contact you again.
