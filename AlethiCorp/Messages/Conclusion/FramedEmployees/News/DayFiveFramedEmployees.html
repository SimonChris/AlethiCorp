  Earlier today, FIRSTNAME LASTNAME, a recently employed Associate Consultant, was
  conclusively proven to be an undercover operative working for IAM, the
  notorious subversive hacker collective.

<p>
  "FIRSTNAME did an impressive job playing the part of the loyal employee," says Sandra 
  Silvern, head of the personal information team at the UK branch. "However, PRONOUN exposed himself
  when asked to make recommendations concerning certain subversive citizens."
</p>

<p>
  "Instead of identifying the obvious subversives, FIRSTNAME tried to implicate AlethiCorp employees in subversive
  activities. Luckily, I knew for a fact that the loyalty of said employees was beyond reproach.
  If I hadn't been so diligent, FIRSTNAME might have succeeded in ruining the careers of several upstanding
  consultants."

  "Investigation revealed that TITLE LASTNAME had recently been in contact with
  other IAM operatives," adds Oskar Jönsson, head of IT security for the UK branch.
  "Immediate steps were taken to isolate OBJECTPRONOUN, and transfer the case to other employees.
  Most of the data was still intact, so we should be able to make our case without too
  much trouble. All told, this could have been a lot worse."
</p>

<p>
  "This is a tragic event", says CEO Alex DuMaurier, speaking to a group of approved
  media representatives. "But it also confirms the importance of the work we
  are doing here at AlethiCorp. Were it not for our information management efforts, subversives
  such as TITLE LASTNAME would be free to pursue their activities, to the detriment
  of decent citizens."
</p>

<p>
  "We are working with the Larkhill Resettlement Council to resettle TITLE LASTNAME to a secure 
  location, where PRONOUN can be safely rehabilitated, without being able to ruin the lives of others.
  Let us hope that PRONOUN one day finds POSSESSIVE place, as a productive citizen of the Union."

  Added Mx. DuMaurier: "In retrospect, we should have seen it coming. Those BEARTYPE types are
  never reliable. I will ensure that steps are taken to improve our hiring processes."
