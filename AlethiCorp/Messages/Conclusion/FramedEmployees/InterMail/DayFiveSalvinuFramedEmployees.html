  I thought you had a lot of potential, but then you had to go and pull a stunt like this.
  You really didn't strike me as a rat. I guess I need to upgrade my "ratdar".
</p>
<p>
  I'll have to find someone else with whom to exchange recipes. I suppose it's all for the best.
  You won't have access to many exotic ingredients where you are going anyway.
</p>
<p>
  However, I would feel bad if I left you with nothing. Here is a simple recipe you should
  be able to make anywhere: Baked mashed potatoes!
</p>
<p>
  You will need 1 kg of potatoes, 1 cup of milk, 110 g of cream cheese, 1 stick of unsalted butter, and 3 large eggs.
</p>
<p>
  Heat the oven to 200°C. Then simmer the potatoes in a large pot with 2-3 cm of water. Cover the pot and steam the potatoes for 20 min
  until tender. Remove the water, and add the other ingredients along with 2 teaspoons of salt and ½ teaspoon of pepper.
  Mash the potatoes, and fold in the eggs, then transfer the mixture to a buttered baking dish. Bake the mixture for 25-30 min, until golden.

  The only ingredient you may have trouble finding is the cream cheese, but you can probably convince
  one of the guards to procure it. I'll put in a good word for you. If you can resist the temptation
  to rat on the other inmates, you might even be able to make some new friends. Good luck with that.
