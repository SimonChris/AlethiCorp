  I thought you had a lot of potential, but then you had to go and pull a stunt like this.
  You really didn't strike me as a rat. I guess I need to upgrade my "ratdar".

  I'll have to find someone else with whom to exchange recipes. I suppose it's all for the best.
  You won't have access to many exotic ingredients where you are going anyway.

<p>
  However, I would feel bad if I left you with nothing, so I have a surprise for you: I've
  arranged for you to keep your spatula!

  Remember how I told you that crêpes can be so much more than dessert? This is your chance to take advantage of this fact!
  Getting hold of some butter and buckwheat flour shouldn't be a problem, and you will cooking up delicious
  crêpes for everyone in no time!
</p>
<p>
  Just take whatever other foodstuff you can find, and use it for fillings! For special occasions, you
  may be able to convince the guards to fetch some extra ingredients for you. If you can resist the temptation
  to rat on the other inmates, you might even be able to make some new friends. Good luck with that.
