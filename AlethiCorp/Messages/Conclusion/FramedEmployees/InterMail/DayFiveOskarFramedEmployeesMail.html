  Congratulations, you're now exposed as an IAM operative. How could you possibly think that you could
  get away with implicating your colleagues? Did you really think we would trust
  you more than them?

  This will look great at my performance review.
  Thanks for helping out with my career. It's appreciated.

  Oh, and please don't do something stupid, like claim that you informed us of the presence of IAM
  operatives. No reason to add perjury to your crimes.
