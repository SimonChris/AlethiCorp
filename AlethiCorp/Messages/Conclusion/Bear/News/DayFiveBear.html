  There has been a shocking development in the case against FIRSTNAME LASTNAME, who, as you may
  recall, was recently revealed to be an IAM operative.
</p>
<p>
  When Information Acquisition agents attempted to apprehend TITLE LASTNAME, a giant bear
  appeared out of fucking nowhere and attacked them! The agents barely escaped with their lives!
</p>
<p>
  "It was the craziest thing I have ever seen in my life," says a witness who lives close to TITLE LASTNAME.
  "When the agents knocked on the door, it flew off the handles and knocked them to the ground. Then the
  bear appeared in the doorway. Its roar was like a lightning bolt striking a volcano."
</p>
<p>
  "The agents opened fire, but that just made it angrier. It swiped the guns from their hands
  with one of its mighty claws, and they ran for their lives. Then TITLE LASTNAME appeared in 
  the doorway and mounted the bear. They rode off towards the sunset, swift as the wind, and 
  PRONOUN smiled to me as they passed."

  "I have seen that bear before," says Benedetto Tornincasa, a human relations consultant. "FIRSTNAME brought it
  to several of our company events, but it seemed very peaceful then. I had no idea it
  possessed such impressive martial prowess."

  "Our agents will be avenged," proclaims Vitaly Vedenin, head of Information Acquisition for the UK branch.
  "I have already dispatched one of our best men, and he is currently pursuing TITLE LASTNAME
  in a crazy adventure across the Eurasian continent. I expect to hear from him shortly."
