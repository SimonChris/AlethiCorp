  I first went to the subjects house, to survey the carnage. The fight between the bear and the agents had
  nearly levelled the building. I resolved not to repeat their mistake. When I meet the bear, I will be ready.

  Luckily, several witnesses had observed the subject leaving, atop the mighty steed. I had no trouble picking
  up their tracks, and soon I was pursuing them across the Eurasian continent. What I saw
  during the pursuit amazed me.

  Everywhere the intrepid couple had gone, they had fought injustice, and liberated people from oppresion.
  I passed town after town of people rejoicing in their newfound freedom.

  As if that wasn't enough they have also been joined by Cédric Kinsinger, the famous journalist. I have
  read a few of the articles he has written during their travels, and its the most amazing investigative
  journalism I have ever seen. It's like Woodward and Bernstein had a threesome with Nellie Bly. Everyone
  who read the articles are inspired to throw of the shackles of oppresion, and become truly free.

  They have also been joined by a subversive woman, whose oratory skills surpass anything I have ever
  heard before. At one town I heard her give an amazing speech, and finishing off with the following
  lines: "Ask for work. If they don't give you work, ask for bread. If they do not give you work or bread, then 
  take FREEEEEDOOOOM." The crowd went wild.

  Together, they are accomplishing truly great things. They have already abolished capitalism in northern
  Germany, from Flensburg to Meckelfeld.
