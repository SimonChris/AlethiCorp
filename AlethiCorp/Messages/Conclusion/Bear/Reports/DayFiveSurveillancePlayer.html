  I first went to the subjects house, to survey the carnage. The fight between the bear and the agents had
  nearly levelled the building. I resolved not to repeat their mistake. When I meet the bear, I will be ready.

<p>
  Luckily, several witnesses had observed the subject leaving, atop the mighty steed. I had no trouble picking
  up their tracks, and soon I was pursuing them across the Eurasian continent. What I saw
  during the pursuit amazed me.
</p>
<p>
  Everywhere the intrepid couple goes, they fight injustice and liberate people from oppression.
  I passed town after town of people rejoicing in their newfound freedom.
</p>
<p>
  As if that wasn't enough, they have also been joined by Cédric Kinsinger, the famous journalist. I have
  read a few of the articles he has written during their travels, and it is the most amazing investigative
  journalism I have ever seen. It's like Woodward and Bernstein had a threesome with Nellie Bly. Everyone
  who reads the articles are inspired to throw of the shackles of oppression and become truly free.
</p>
<p>
  They have also been joined by a subversive woman, whose oratory skills surpass anything I have ever
  heard before. At one town I heard her give an amazing speech, finishing with the following
  lines: "Ask for work. If they don't give you work, ask for bread. If they do not give you work or bread, then
  take <a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="this.innerHTML = this.innerHTML.replace('O', 'OO')">FREEEEEDOOOOM</a>." The crowd went wild.
</p>
<p>
  Together, they are accomplishing truly great things. They have already abolished capitalism in northern
  Germany, from Flensburg to Meckelfeld. I can only imagine what they will accomplish as they move on
  through Europe.
</p>
<p>
  In fact, I have become increasingly sympathetic to their cause. From reading their articles, listening
  to their speeches, and seeing their results, I have come to realise that my work contributes
  to the propagation of oppression and injustice. No more, I say!
</p>
<p>
  Thus, this will be my last report. From this day on, I am no longer "D06". I am not an alphanumeric designation,
  I am a free man!
</p>
<p>
  When I meet the bear, I will be ready.
