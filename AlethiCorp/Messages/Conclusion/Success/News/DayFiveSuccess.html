  After a week of hard work involving several departments, another important AlethiCorp investigation
  has concluded successfully. The investigation involved subversive elements connected to
  the social milieu around Cambridge, and has resulted in numerous arrests.

  "The investigation turned out to be about something far bigger than we first suspected," says Sandra
  Silvern, head of the personal information team at the UK branch. "The whole thing started when
  it was brought to our attention that a local young author had recently published a highly subversive work.
  This is not illegal in itself, of course, but raised suspicions that he might be connected
  to more millitant groups."

<p>
  "In collaboration with Information Acquisition our consultants soon uncovered a subversive conspiracy.
  The author turned out to be connected to subversive student groups, who were not only
  attempting to subvert their fellow students, but also planning outright acts of terror."

  "Our agents should be commended for their bravery," says Vitaly Vedenin, head of Information Acquisition.
  "At great risk to their personal safety, department assets managed to infiltrate
  these subversive student groups, and gather information on their terrorist plans."
</p>
<p>
  "Not only that, but they also managed to prove that the terrorist groups were connected 
  to IAM, the notorious subversive hacker collective, and were even trying to subvert the media. 
  Our citizens can rest assured that the integrity of the fourth estate has been secured."

  "I would also like to give a shout-out to the excellent consultants in the personal information team",
  says Sandra Silvern. "Without experienced employees such as Sháo Lingfei and Salvinu Manduca
  this investigation would not have been nearly as succesful."

  "This is a day of triumph", says CEO Alex DuMaurier, speaking to a group of approved
  media representatives. "And it also confirms the importance of the work we
  are doing here at AlethiCorp. Were it not for our information management efforts, subversive
  groups would be free to pursue their activities, to the detriment of decent citizens."

  "However, we must remember that such people, are misguided souls, who should be pitied, not hated. 
  We are working with the Larkhill Resettlement Council to resettle everyone involved to more appropriate 
  locations, where they can be safely rehabilitated. Let us hope that they will one day find their places, 
  as a productive citizens of the Union."
