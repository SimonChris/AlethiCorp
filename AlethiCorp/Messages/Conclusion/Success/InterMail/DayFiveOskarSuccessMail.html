  Congratulations on your success. You've handled yourself nicely.

  Oh, and thanks for keeping me up to date with the IAM operatives, who tried to subvert you.
  That's important stuff, and I don't have time to sift through everyone's mails
  every single day.

  We are keeping tabs on the hackers and will be dealing with them any day now. You
  don't need to worry about that.
