  Earlier today, FIRSTNAME LASTNAME, a recently employed Associate Consultant, was
  conclusively proven to be an undercover operative working for IAM, the
  notorious subversive hacker collective.

<p>
  "FIRSTNAME did an impressive job playing the part of the loyal employee," says Sandra 
  Silvern, head of the personal information team at the UK branch. "However, PRONOUN exposed himself
  when asked to make recommendations concerning certain subversive citizens."
</p>

<p>
  "In spite of overwhelming evidence of subversion, FIRSTNAME tried to cover this up, and refused
  to identify any credible major threats. Luckily, I had assigned more experienced consultants to review POSSESSIVE results.
  It didn't take them long to realize what PRONOUN was doing. If I hadn't been so diligent, FIRSTNAME might
  have done a great deal of harm to the investigation."

  "Investigation revealed that TITLE LASTNAME had recently been in contact with
  other IAM operatives," adds Oskar Jöhnsson, head of IT security for the UK branch.
  "Immediate steps were taken to isolate OBJECTPRONOUN, and transfer the case to other employees.
  Most of the data was still intact, so we should be able to make our case without too
  much trouble. All told, this could have been a lot worse."
</p>

<p>
  "This is a tragic event", says CEO Alex DuMaurier, speaking to a group of approved
  media representatives. "But it also confirms the importance of the work we
  are doing here at AlethiCorp. Were it not for our information management efforts, subversives
  such as TITLE LASTNAME would be free to pursue their activities, to the detriment
  of decent citizens."
</p>

<p>
  "However, we must remember that FIRSTNAME LASTNAME, and others like OBJECTPRONOUN, are misguided
  souls, who should be pitied, not hated. We are working with the Larkhill Resettlement Council
  to resettle TITLE LASTNAME to an appropriate location, where PRONOUN can be safely rehabilitated. 
  Let us hope that PRONOUN one day finds POSSESSIVE place, as a productive citizen of the Union."

  Added Mx. DuMaurier: "In retrospect, we should have seen it coming. Those BEARTYPE types are
  never reliable. I will ensure that steps are taken to improve our hiring processes."
