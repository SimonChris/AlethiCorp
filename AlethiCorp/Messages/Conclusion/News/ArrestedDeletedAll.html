  Earlier today, FIRSTNAME LASTNAME, a recently employed Associate Consultant, was
  conclusively proven to be an undercover operative working for IAM, the
  notorious subversive hacker collective.

<p>
  "We're lucky that TITLE LASTNAME was caught so early," says Oskar Jönsson, head of
  IT security for the UK branch. "As soon as PRONOUN received access to the database,
  PRONOUN proceeded to delete as much data as possible, severely disrupting an important
  AlethiCorp investigation."
</p>

<p>
  "Investigation revealed that TITLE LASTNAME had recently been in contact with
  other IAM operatives, and steps were taken to prevent further damage. Had PRONOUN been more
  discreet, there is no telling how much damage PRONOUN might have caused."
</p>

<p>
  "This is a tragic event", says CEO Alex DuMaurier, speaking to a group of approved
  media representatives. "But it also confirms the importance of the work we
  are doing here at AlethiCorp. Were it not for our information management efforts, subversives
  such as TITLE LASTNAME would be free to pursue their activities, to the detriment
  of decent citizens."
</p>

<p>
  "However, we must remember that FIRSTNAME LASTNAME, and others like OBJECTPRONOUN, are misguided
  souls, who should be pitied, not hated. We are working with the Larkhill Resettlement Council
  to resettle TITLE LASTNAME to an appropriate location, where PRONOUN can be safely rehabilitated. 
  Let us hope that PRONOUN one day finds POSSESSIVE place, as a productive citizen of the Union."

  Added Mx. DuMaurier: "In retrospect, we should have seen it coming. Those BEARTYPE types are
  never reliable. I will ensure that steps are taken to improve our hiring processes."
