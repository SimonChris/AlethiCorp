  Earlier today, FIRSTNAME LASTNAME, a recently employed Associate Consultant, was
  conclusively proven to be aa dangerous terrorist working for IAM, the
  notorious subversive hacker collective.
</p>

<p>
  "We suspected TITLE LASTNAME from the beginning," says Vitaly Vedenin, head of Information Acquisition for the UK
  branch. "Our background checks had revealed certain  disturbing connections, so when PRONOUN applied for
  a position we kept OBJECTPRONOUN under strict supervision."
</p>

<p>
  "To test POSSESSIVE loyalty, AlethiCorp employees made contact, posing as IAM operatives. FIRSTNAME immediately
  demanded to be involved in the most dangerous IAM assignments, and insisted that the subversive
  cause justified any means."
</p>

<p>
  "I was taken aback by FIRSTNAME's bloodlust," says Oskar Jöhnsson, head of
  IT security, who ran the operation along with Information Acquisition. "I was expecting 
  OBJECTPRONOUN to report the contact to security, but instead PRONOUN gleefully embraced the
  opportunity to work with IAM terrorists."
</p>

<p>
  "At the end of the operation, we made FIRSTNAME believe that IAM had given OBJECTPRONOUN access to drone strikes.
  FIRSTNAME wasted no time in organizing what would have been an unprecedented act of mass murder, had this whole
  thing not been a carefully controlled sting operation. It sends chills down my spine when I consider what
  might have happened had FIRSTNAME LASTNAME not been exposed."
</p>

<p>
  "This is a tragic event", said CEO Alex DuMaurier, speaking to a group of approved
  media representatives. "But it also confirms the importance of the work we
  are doing here at AlethiCorp. Were it not for our information management efforts,
  there is no telling how many innocents might have been killed by FIRSTNAME
  LASTNAME's terrorist acts.
</p>

<p>
  "However, we must remember that FIRSTNAME LASTNAME, and others like OBJECTPRONOUN, are misguided
  souls, who should be pitied, not hated. We are working with the Larkhill Resettlement Council
  to resettle TITLE LASTNAME to a high-security location, where PRONOUN can live POSSESSIVE life, without
  being a danger to ordinary citizens. Let us hope that PRONOUN will one day find a measure of peace."

  Added Mx. DuMaurier: "In retrospect, we should have seen it coming. Those BEARTYPE types are
  never reliable. I will ensure that steps are taken to improve our hiring processes."
