  Sorry, but you really should have seen that coming :). It's not like we were being subtle or anything!

  I am sorry it had to end this way, but I hope you understand that it isn't personal. 
  I was looking forward to getting to know you better and seeing what you would come
  up with at the company events :). A job is a job, though, and you brought this upon yourself.

  I am sure you will be just fine at your new location. I can give you some pointers
  on fun events you can organise with your fellow subversives. You will make tons of new
  friends in no time :):):).
