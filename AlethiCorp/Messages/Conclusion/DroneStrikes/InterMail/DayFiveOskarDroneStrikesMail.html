  Congratulations, you're now exposed as an IAM operative. You made that way too easy.
  Did you really think we would allow IAM hackers free rein to mess with out website like that?
  And that no one would notice they were using our internal mail system?

  This will look great at my performance review.
  Thanks for helping out with my career. It's appreciated.

  Oh, and please don't do something stupid, like claim that you informed us of the presence of IAM
  operatives. No reason to add perjury to your crimes.
