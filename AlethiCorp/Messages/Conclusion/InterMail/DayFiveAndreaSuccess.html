  "Do you need an introduction to Emma Goldman? You have seen supposed pictures of her. You have read of her 
  as a property-destroying, capitalist-killing, riot-promoting agitator. You see her in your mind a great

  You seem to be doing pretty well for yourself, so that shouldn't be a problem. I'll be in touch.

  "I took upon myself to enact the part of a poor, unfortunate crazy girl, and felt it my duty not to shirk any 
  of the disagreeable results that should follow." - Nellie Bly
