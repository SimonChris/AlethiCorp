  "Do you need an introduction to Emma Goldman? You have seen supposed pictures of her. You have read of her 
  as a property-destroying, capitalist-killing, riot-promoting agitator. You see her in your mind a great 
  raw-boned creature, with short hair and bloomers, a red flag in one hand, a burning torch in the other; both 
  feet constantly off of the ground and 'murder!' continually upon her lips."

  "The [sic] was my ideal of her, I confess, and when the matron stood before me saying, 'This is Emma Goldman,' I gasped in
  surprise and then laughed."

  That's right, she gasped and then laughed! It would seem that you <i>do</i> know a thing or two about Nellie
  Bly, and didn't just skim her omnipedia article. Most people these days haven't even heard about Nellie
  Bly, much less know anything about her. We should get together and talk some day!

  There is the little problem of you getting yourself arrested, of course, but that's manageable. I've been cooped up
  in my office for too long anyway, and perhaps it's time that I started actually following Goldman's example, instead
  of recommending surveillance and drone strikes. Emma Goldman would never recommend a drone strike (well, maybe
  when she was young, but not in her final form).

  Anyway, enough rambling. Operatives are on their way to your home as I write this. I'm parked out back
  in my Ford Thunderbird convertible. If you're interested, meet me here ASAP, and we'll blow this
  joint together.

  "I had looked forward so eagerly to leaving the horrible place, yet when my release came and I knew that God's sunlight
  was to be free for me again, there was a certain pain in leaving." - Nellie Bly
