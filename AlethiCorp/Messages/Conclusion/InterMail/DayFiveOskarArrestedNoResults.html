  Congratulations, you're now exposed as an IAM operative. You made it way too obvious.
  Only an undercover operative could possibly choose to ignore
  so much evidence of subversive activity. If you wanted to infiltrate us, you should at least have
  given us a fall guy of some kind.

  This will look great at my performance review.
  Thanks for helping out with me career. It's appreciated.
