  Subjects have managed to escape the UK, and are now fleeing across Europe. I tracked them to a cowboy bar in Meckelfeld,
  where there had apparently been an altercation, concluding with the brutal murder of an innocent bar
  patron by TITLE LASTNAME. Subject should be considered armed and extremely dangerous.

  During my pursuit across Germany, I soon discovered that TITLE LASTNAME had joined forces with a recently
  paroled thief, likely a fellow IAM terrorist. From interviewing witnesses, I later learned that TITLE LASTNAME
  had apparently had a falling out with POSSESSIVE accomplice, who had absconded with TITLE LASTNAME's funds.

  Unfortunately, this had the side-effect of making TITLE LASTNAME even more desperate. In Austria
  PRONOUN perpetrated an armed robbery of a convenience store, leaving several innocent civilians
  severely traumatized.

  In Slovenia, a local peace officer recognized the subjects, and pulled them over. TITLE LASTNAME
  held him at gunpoint, locked him in the trunk of the car, and took his gun and ammunition.

  In Croatia, the subjects opened fire at a tanker truck, with no provocation, causing an explosion.
  The driver, a Miss Hannah Abendroth, insists that both subjects participated in the attack.
  At this point, I was forced to conclude that Miss Schueler must be suffering from Stockholm
  syndrome.

  I finally cornered the subjects at Tara River Canyon in Montenegro. They had nowhere left
  to go. I pleaded with them both to surrender peacefully.

<p>
  The subjects kept going.
