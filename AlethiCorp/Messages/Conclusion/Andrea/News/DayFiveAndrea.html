  There has been a shocking development in the case against FIRSTNAME LASTNAME, who, as you may
  recall, was recently revealed to be an IAM operative.

<p>
  When Information Acquisition agents attempted to apprehend TITLE LASTNAME, they discovered that PRONOUN
  had somehow managed to kidnap Andrea Schueler, the head of the Literature department at the UK branch,
  and was using her as a hostage. Agents were forced to retreat to ensure the safety of Miss Schueler.
  TITLE LASTNAME escaped in a blue Ford Thunderbird convertible, and was last seen heading south, along
  with POSSESSIVE hostage.

  "This vile act of cowardice will not go unpunished," says Vitaly Vedenin, head of Information Acquisition
  for the UK branch. "I have already dispatched one of our best men, and he is currently in pursuit
  of TITLE LASTNAME. I expect that Miss Schueler will be returned to us safely any time now."
