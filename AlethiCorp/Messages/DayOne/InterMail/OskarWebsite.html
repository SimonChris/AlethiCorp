    You may have noticed that our website is currently suffering from
    yet another hacker infestation. The culprits are probably the usual IAM people.

    We are working round the clock to fix the problem, but the
    IT security department is a bit understaffed. Apparently, securing our own website
    is not considered a priority. As long as the problem doesn’t spread beyond the public page,
    what could possibly go wrong? The security holes should be fixed in a few days. In the
    meantime, report all suspicious web activity.
