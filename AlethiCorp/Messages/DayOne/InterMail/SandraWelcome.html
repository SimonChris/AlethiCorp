<p>Good morning, FIRSTNAME!</p>
<p>
    First, let me heartily welcome you to the AlethiCorp family! You will
    be working under my supervision, as part of the personal information team. We all look
    forward to working with you.
</p>
<p>
    To begin with, I’ve found a straightforward assignment for you, to help you get
    familiar with the work you will be doing. Go to the Information section, and take a look at the
    available data. I have given you access to some information related to a certain Martin Brightfield.
    Mr. Brightfield recently published a mildly controversial novel, and a client would like 
    us to perform a background check.</p>
<p>
    If you find anything
    interesting, flag it for further investigation. Now, we have limited resources, so please don’t
    flag more than three items to begin with. For the same reason, feel free to delete all the
    useless chatter no one will ever need.
</p>
<p>
    Oh, and make sure you read Andrea Schueler’s analysis of the book. Miss
    Schueler is one of our foremost experts on subversive literature.
</p>
<p>
    Also, while you have access to the InterMail system, please keep in mind that most employees are
    way to busy to spend all day answering mails. Why, most days I barely have time to skim my mails
    for important points!
</p>
<p>
    Once you’re done, remember to log your work hours at the Timelog section. I
    look forward to seeing if you find anything. We’ll talk more at the afternoon Haka meeting,
    later today. See you then!
</p>
<p>
    PS: If you have no idea what an afternoon Haka meeting is, you should take the Introduction to Haka
    course, available at the online University :).
