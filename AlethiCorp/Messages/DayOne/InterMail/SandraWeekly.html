    Good morning, Team! Last week was very productive. As usual, you
    have done an excellent job locating the important snippets of information in the sea of
    irrelevant clutter that fills the AlethiCorp databases. However, management is concerned
    that a greater than normal percentage of people examined have been determined to be
    unsuspicious. Obviously, you can’t find what isn’t there, but let’s be extra diligent that we
    aren’t missing any genuine suspicious activity. Sometimes, it can be easy to miss the
    forest for the trees. Remember: The price of freedom is eternal vigilance!
</p>
<p>Also, I would like to welcome FIRSTNAME LASTNAME to the personal information team! Let us all do our best to make
FIRSTNAME feel at home. There will be cake in the kitchen later.</p>
<p>With that, now it’s time for...</p>
<p>Train of the week!</p>

    An old but reliable model, this train engine steadfastly carries on, transporting
    its cargo through a winding route between the wooded hills. Like the train, we should do
    our jobs without caring how we look, never losing sight of the trees on our route.
