<p>Hi, FIRSTNAME!</p>

<p>
    Good to see new additions to the team :). You're just in time for the team potluck
    this evening. Hurry up, and sign up at the Social section!
</p>
<p>
    You can pick something to bring, if you want to, but it's fine if you don't have time to make anything. 
    I realise it's short notice, and the important thing is that we have fun together!
</p>

<p>We all hope to see you there!</p>
