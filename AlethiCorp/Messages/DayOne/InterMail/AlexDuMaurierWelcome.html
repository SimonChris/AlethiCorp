    As you have all heard by now, I have been appointed the new CEO
    of the AlethiCorp group, replacing Alice Sheldon. AlethiCorp has performed well under
    Alice, but there have been challenges, mostly relating to lack of synergy. All too often,
    consultants from different teams turn out to have been working on pieces of the same
    puzzle, without ever realizing it. My first priority as new CEO will be to ameliorate this
    problem by ensuring a greater degree of cross-team communication, and synergistic
    interaction. Together, we will take AlethiCorp to new heights!

    I would also like to welcome all the new employees that have recently joined
    the AlethiCorp family. It’s great to see the group growing so fast. I have no doubt that you
    will all find your career with AlethiCorp to be both rewarding and meaningful.
