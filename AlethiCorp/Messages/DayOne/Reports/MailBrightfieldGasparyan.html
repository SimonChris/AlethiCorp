  Dear Mr. Gasparyan
</p>
<p>
  I was wondering if you have had time to take a look at my book yet? It has been almost a month
  since I sent you the manuscript. While I realize that Melik-Baumgartner is a very selective
  publishing house, it would be great if you could at least give me a few words of feedback.
</p>
<p>
  I thank you in advance for your time.

  Dear Mr. Brightfield
</p>
<p>
  I have taken a look at your book, and while it shows promise, I'm afraid it's not what we are looking
  for at this moment. I encourage you to keep writing, and I'm sure you will be successful one day.
</p>
<p>
  P.S: Please stop sending us letters every week.

  Dear Mr. Gasparyan
</p>
<p>
  I appreciate your reply, but your response seems quite generic. I feel like my book would
  fit perfectly into Melik-Baumgartner's current lineup, as it contains both excitement, and
  social criticism.
</p>
<p>
  If you could only point to some specific parts of the book that you feel need improvement, I
  will be happy to take your feedback into account.
</p>
<p>
  P.P.S: From now on I will send you TWO letters every week!

<p>
  I must confess that I find your persistence admirable. Here is the deal: If you promise to stop
  sending us letters, I will <i>actually</i> take a look at your book, and give you some specific
  feedback. I hope you find this proposition acceptable.

  That's perfect. All I want is for you to actually look at the book, and give it a shot :)

  Thank you so much for your time!
