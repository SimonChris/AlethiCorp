    Emma Goldman once said: ”When we can't dream any longer we die.” If she
    had known what would pass as subversive literature in the future, she would have slit her
    wrists in the bathtub. “On the Tracks”, the debut novel of Martin Brightfield, is a perfect
    example.
</p>
<p>
    The book is set in the “near future”, where civilisation is apparently starting to
    break apart for no apparent reason. Riots, market crashes and other disasters are
    occurring with increasing frequency. The main character, who is obviously an idealized
    version of the author, has realized the shocking truth: Society is naturally acting out
    against excessive government control, and the government response is only serving to
    accelerate the effect. True order can only arise as an emergent property of freely
    interacting agents and oh my god, who writes like this?
</p>
<p>
    At this point, our intrepid hero launches into a 14-page speech on complexity
    science and the butterfly effect, while the rest of the characters listen in awe. The whole
    thing reads as if a high school student who had just finished the latest Jurassic Park
    sequel wrote it. At least a dinosaur eventually ate Ian Malcolm. No such luck here.
</p>
    After his big speech, the main character describes his plan to start a new
    society. At this point, it becomes apparent that the author is completely in love with the
    inane train metaphor from which the book derives its title. Look at this:
<p>
    “’Is it really necessary to leave, John?’ said Lily. ‘Can’t we stay and fix society
    from the inside? It can’t be too late. It can’t!’"
</p>
<p>
    "‘It’s no good, Lily,’ I sighed lugubriously. ‘We have reached the tipping point.
    Society is on the track to disaster, and if we don’t get off the train we will go right over the
    cliff with the rest of them.’ I looked towards the horizon, where the sun was setting. ‘We
    have to build something new. Out there.’”
</p>
<p>What the hell.</p>
<p>
    Anyway, it turns out that there is conveniently a big field or something right
    outside “civilisation”, ideal for starting new societies. It is never explained why this area
    has not been claimed by any of the all-controlling governments. The heroes start a society
    that is truly free because everyone does what the main character says. I just can’t wait
    to live in this perfect utopia.
</p>
<p>
    I wish I could recommend stronger action against this shit – I mean, the
    dialogue alone merits a drone strike — but I’m afraid the actual subversive element is
    pretty weak. Even the Big Governments come off as mostly well-meaning buffoons. The
    main characters are content to just leave, and go do their own thing.
</p>
<p>Still, I guess some people might use this as inspiration for more direct action.</p>
<p>Better safe than sorry.</p>
