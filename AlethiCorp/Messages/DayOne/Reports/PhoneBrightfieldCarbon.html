<p><b>Martin:</b> Hi, Honey!</p>
<p><b>Patricia:</b> Hi, Martin. You busy?</p>
<p><b>Martin:</b> No, I’m just *unintelligible* my route. What’s up?</p>
<p><b>Patricia:</b> Well, do you remember that new study group I told you about?</p>
<p><b>Martin:</b> Yeah?</p>
<p>
    <b>Patricia:</b> So I talked to them, and they insist that I ought to meet them tonight,
    at the Philma common room. Is it okay if I cancel our date? I’m really sorry. I’ll make it up
    to you some other day.
</p>
<p><b>Martin:</b> Oh… Yeah, that’s okay. We’ll figure something out another day.</p>
<p><b>Patricia:</b> Of course. Gotta run. Love you!</p>
<p><b>Martin:</b> Love you too!</p>
