    Morning, Pat. I just picked up the first run of my novel from the printers today.
    It’s great to finally see it in print. So, how does it feel to date a novelist :). I know, it’s self published,
    but it still feels great to see the results of all that hard work, and hold it in my
    hand. I’ll stop by some bookstores on my route, and see if I can persuade them to carry it.
    How are you doing at Philma? Wanna grab a bite when you are done with
    your study group?

    That’s awesome! I can’t wait to see it. I still think you should have tightened up
    the plot a bit, but perfect is the enemy of good. I’d love to go out tonight, but I’ve got a LOT
    of studying to do, and I promised the others I’d stay until we’re done. How about
    tomorrow?

    Tomorrow is fine, too :). I’ll pick you up on my bike after I’m done with my
    route. What do you feel like? Fish’n' chips? Or something fancier? We’ll work that out
    tomorrow! How are things with your study group, anyway? Do you still feel like they’re
    holding you back?

    Fish’n' chips is cool. I’ll probably be too tired to enjoy anything fancy anyway.
    We’ll go for something more fancy in the weekend, when I’ve caught up with the exams.

    About the group… I hate to sound like a jerk, but I do feel like I’m the one who
    is doing all the work. It’s not like they’re stupid, you know, it just feels like they only want to
    do the bare minimum to pass. We’re doing Frege atm and all they want to do is memorise
    axioms. It’s like they don’t care about set theory at all!
</p>
<p>
    I’ve been looking around campus, and I think I might have found a better
    group. I’ve only spoken to them briefly, but they are a lot more dedicated and passionate
    than the others. I’ll tell you more about it tomorrow :).
