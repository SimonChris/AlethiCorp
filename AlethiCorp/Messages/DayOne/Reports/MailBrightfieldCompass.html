    Evening, Uncle. I was just wondering if you’ve had time to take a look at the
    book, yet? I’m really excited to hear your opinion. I know it probably isn’t your type of
    literature, but your feedback has always been valuable. I know there is plenty of room for
    improvement in my writing, but I’m hoping you will still find something to like :).

    Dear, Martin. I’ve read your book, though I confess that I found it of more
    interest as a window into your mind than as a work of literature. While you do have some
    valid points, they are, quite frankly, presented in such a ham-fisted way, that it’s hard to
    take them seriously. I was particularly annoyed by the constant speeches made by the
    main character. As cliche as it is, try showing the reader your points rather than explaining
    them. Let the events speak for themselves! I know you can do better than this.

    That said, the prose is not entirely awful (though, in all honesty, the same
    cannot be said of the dialogue). Polish your writing, tighten the plotting, and try to listen to
    how real people actually talk. Then you might have a shot at becoming a good writer.

    I hope you take this criticism in the spirit it was intended. You know how much
    I care about you. I just think you are still quite far from your goal.

    Thank you so much for the feedback! Of course I will take it in the spirit you
    intended. I know you’re highly critical of literature, it comes with your job of course, so
    coming from you “not entirely awful” is practically high praise :). I’ll work on my dialogue
    some more, and maybe publish a new edition someday.
</p>
<p>See you later!</p>
