<p><b>Samuel:</b> Hey, Martin.</p>
<p><b>Martin:</b> Hey, Sam. You busy?</p>
<p>
    <b>Samuel:</b> Oh, just putting bricks on top of other bricks, like I usually do this time
    of day. What’s up?
</p>
<p>
    <b>Martin:</b> I was just wondering if you are free this afternoon? I was thinking we
    could have a pint down at The Goose, and I can tell you about my book!
</p>
<p>
    <b>Samuel:</b> Is that out already? I’ll love to read it! Just don’t expect me to go easy
    on you.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Martin:</b> Course, not! I need merciless feedback to improve. Hannah won’t
    mind?
</p>
<p>
    <b>Samuel:</b> Oh, no, she’s in Germany again doing the *unintelligible* between
    Stuttgart and Hamburg. This week, I’ve plenty of time for talking.
</p>
<p><b>Martin:</b> Awesome! See you later.</p>
<p><b>Samuel:</b> See you!</p>
