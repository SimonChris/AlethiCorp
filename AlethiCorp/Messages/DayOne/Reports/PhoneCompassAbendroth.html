<p><b>Hannah:</b> Hannah, here.</p>
<p><b>Samuel:</b> Hi, Honey. It’s me.</p>
<p><b>Hannah:</b> Sam! What’s up?</p>
<p><b>Samuel:</b> I just needed to hear your voice. How are you doing?</p>
<p>
    <b>Hannah:</b> Delivering a truckload of fruit to Hamburg. *laughs*. Hamburg must
    really love bananas. The weather is beautiful down here. I wish you could see it.

<p><b>Samuel:</b> Someday I’ll come with you… When are you back?</p>
<p><b>Hannah:</b> I’ll be in London next Friday. Then we can go out together.</p>
<p><b>Samuel:</b> I’ll find a good restaurant. I can’t wait till you’re back.</p>
<p><b>Hannah:</b> Me too. I really have to go. I’m driving a truck, you know!</p>
<p><b>Samuel:</b> Right. Of, course. See you. *Kissing sound, I think*.</p>
<p><b>Hannah:</b> See you soon.</p>
