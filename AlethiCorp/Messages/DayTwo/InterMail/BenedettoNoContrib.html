<p>Good morning, FIRSTNAME</p>
<p>
    It was great to see you yesterday! It's too bad you didn't have time to cook anything, but that's fine.
    The important thing is that you were there. Getting to know your colleagues is important
    for both team-building and job satisfaction!
</p>
<p>
    As for now, you should sign up for the onboarding event tomorrow morning. This is a great opportunity to meet
    the other recent employees and learn about the history of the company! You don't need to bring anything but
    a cheerful mood and a sunny disposition :).
