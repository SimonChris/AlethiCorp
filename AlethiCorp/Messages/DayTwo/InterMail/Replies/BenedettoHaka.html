<p>Hello, FIRSTNAME!</p>

<p>
    It's great to hear from you! Communicating with your colleagues is a very important step towards
    becoming a productive part of the AlethiCorp family :).

<p>
    Adam Underwood is our Haka facilitator, so you should probably contact him if you have any questions
    about Haka. I haven't seen him since the last introspective, come to think of it. I hope he is well.

    See you at the onboarding event!
