    Hi, FIRSTNAME
</p>
<p>
    That's great, but I'm afraid I really don't have time to answer mails from everyone in the team.
    You'll have ample opportunity to describe your work at the daily Haka meetings.
</p>
<p>
    Please don't take this the wrong way. We'll love to hear your input, but it has to happen within
    the Haka framework :).
