    Hi, FIRSTNAME
</p>
<p>
    Adam Underwood is our Haka facilitator, now that you mention it. I think he is ill at the moment.
    We haven't seen him since the last jump introspective, anyway.
</p>
<p>
    It doesn't matter. We've all done the Haka course, and can figure things out on our own until
    Adam is well again :).
