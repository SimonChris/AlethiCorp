<p>Thanks for your input, but I'm rather busy fixing critical security holes at the moment.</p>

    I'm flooded with reports from people convinced that various website idiosyncrasies are the works
    of nefarious IAM operatives, and can't possibly check them all. I'm sure if I spent all day reading mails 
    from associate consultants, I would eventually discover some incredible insights. Alas, It is not to be.

    Don't bother sending me anything, unless it's literally a mail your received from a hacker, or something.
