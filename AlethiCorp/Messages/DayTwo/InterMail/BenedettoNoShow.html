<p>Good morning, FIRSTNAME</p>
<p>
    I'm sorry you couldn't make it to the potluck yesterday, but I know it can be hard to make time on such short notice.
</p>
<p>
    You should try to prioritize social events in the future, though. Getting to know your colleagues is important
    for both team-building and job satisfaction!
</p>
<p>
    As for now, you should sign up for the onboarding event tomorrow morning. This is a great opportunity to meet
    the other recent employees and learn about the history of the company! You don't need to bring anything but
    a cheerful mood and a sunny disposition :).
