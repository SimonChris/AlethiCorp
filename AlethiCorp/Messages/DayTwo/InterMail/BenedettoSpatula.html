<p>Good morning, FIRSTNAME</p>
<p>
    It was great to see you yesterday! I think you may have misunderstood the purpose of a potluck, though.
    You're supposed to bring a dish, not just a spatula!</p>
<p>
    Don't worry about it, though :). The important thing is that you were there. Getting to know your colleagues is important
    for both team-building and job satisfaction!
</p>
<p>
    As for now, you should sign up for the onboarding event tomorrow morning. This is a great opportunity to meet
    the other recent employees and learn about the history of the company! You don't need to bring anything but
    a cheerful mood and a sunny disposition :).
