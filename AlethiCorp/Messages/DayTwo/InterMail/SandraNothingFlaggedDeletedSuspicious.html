<p>Hi, FIRSTNAME</p>
<p>
    Did you really not find any of the information suspicious or meriting further investigation?
    It's ok if that's really the case, but try to be vigilant, so things don't slip through the cracks :).

    It turns out that a routine sweep of the Cambridge campus area has uncovered something that may
    be related to your original assignment: A crate of subversive pamphlets apparently written by some
    of the students! Andrea Schueler thinks it's important enough to merit a higher grade of surveillance.

    Furthermore, there is a journalist doing a report on subversive
    tendencies in the Cambridge academic community, and our client feels that this might uncover some
    useful information. Information regarding this individual has been added as well.
