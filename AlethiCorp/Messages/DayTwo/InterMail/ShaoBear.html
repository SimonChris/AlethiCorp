<p>Hi FIRSTNAME.</p>

<p>
    It appears that we will be working together for this assignment.
    It's always good to get to know people from the team.
    I think we met briefly at the potluck. You're the bear GENDERREF, right?
    That was awesome! I'm sure we will have a great time working together!

    I've looked through the available information for this assignment, and cleared you for some of it.
    Check it out and flag anything you find suspicious. Try not to flag more than three or four items, though.
    I spoke to Vita last Friday, and Information Retrieval are really busy these days.
    Let's not be too hard on them :).
