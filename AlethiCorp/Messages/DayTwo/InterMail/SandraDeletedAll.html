<p>Wait, did you seriously just delete ALL the data I gave you access to?</p>
<p>
    FIRSTNAME, I'm sorry but I find it very hard to believe that every single piece of data was completely useless.
    Just because something doesn't merit further investigation, doesn't mean it can't prove useful
    in the future. Please try to keep that in mind. I sure hope none of it was important.

    It's my mistake, really. I shouldn't have given you so much responsibility on your first day.
    What was I thinking!

    As it happens, I have a new assignment for you. There is a journalist doing a report on subversive
    tendencies in the Cambridge academic community, and our client feels that this might uncover some
    useful information.
</p>
<p>
    Futhermore, it turns out that a routine sweep of the Cambridge campus area has uncovered something that may
    be related to your original assignment: A crate of subversive pamphlets apparently written by some
    of the students! Check out Andrea Schueler's analysis, and try to see if you can figure out who is
    responsible.

    Since you're obviously not ready to work alone, you will be reporting to Shào Jingfei. Miss Shào is
    an experienced consultant, and will be responsible for monitoring your work.
    I hope you have learned from your mistake, and will do a better job this time.
