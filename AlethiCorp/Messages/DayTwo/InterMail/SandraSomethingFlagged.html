<p>Hi, FIRSTNAME</p>
<p>
    I see you managed to find some suspicious pieces of information :). That's good. Some of our
    consultants let way too many things pass, if you ask me.
</p>
<p>
    However, you seem to have missed an important piece of the puzzle. Luckily, I had a more
    experienced consultant, Miss Shào Jingfei, go through the reports, to  ensure you didn't 
    miss anything important. She flagged a phone conversation that led our agents to a subversive 
    meeting! The information should be available to you now. Make sure you don't miss anything this time.
</p>
<p>
    Furthermore, there is a journalist doing a report on subversive tendencies in the Cambridge 
    academic community, and our client feels that this might uncover some useful information. 
    Information regarding this individual has been added as well.
</p>
<p>
    To ensure that nothing is missed, you will be reporting to Shào Jingfei from now on. 
    Miss Shào is an experienced consultant and will be responsible for monitoring your work.
    I hope you have learned to be extra dilligent :).
