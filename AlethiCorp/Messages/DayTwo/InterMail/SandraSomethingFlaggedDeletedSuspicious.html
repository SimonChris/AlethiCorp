<p>Hi, FIRSTNAME</p>
<p>
  I see you managed to find some suspicious pieces of information :). That's good. Some of our
  consultants let way too many things pass, if you ask me.
  Keep up the good work, and I'm sure you will be catching dangerous terrorists in no time!

  It turns out that a routine sweep of the Cambridge campus area has uncovered something that may
  be related to your assignment: A crate of subversive pamphlets apparently written by some
  of the students! Andrea Schueler thinks it's important enough to merit a higher grade of surveillance.

  Furthermore, there is a journalist doing a report on subversive
  tendencies in the Cambridge academic community, and our client feels that this might uncover some
  useful information. Information regarding this individual has been added as well.

  Due to the increased importance of the investigation, you will be reporting to Shào Jingfei from now on.
  Miss Shào is an experienced consultant and will be responsible for monitoring your work.
  I hope you continue to be as diligent as you have been so far :).
