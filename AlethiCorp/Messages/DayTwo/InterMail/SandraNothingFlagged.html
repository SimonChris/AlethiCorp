<p>Hi, FIRSTNAME</p>
<p>
    Did you really not find any of the information suspicious or meriting further investigation?
    Remember what I wrote about the need to be vigilant, so things don't slip through?
</p>
<p>
    Luckily, I had a more experienced consultant, Miss Shào Jingfei, go through the reports, to 
    ensure you didn't miss anything.
    She flagged a phone conversation that led our agents to a subversive meeting! The information
    should be available to you now. Make sure you read it properly this time! 
</p>
<p>
    Furthermore, there is a journalist doing a report on subversive
    tendencies in the Cambridge academic community, and our client feels that this might uncover some
    useful information. Information regarding this individual has been added as well.
</p>
<p>
    To ensure that nothing is missed, you will be reporting to Shào Jingfei from now on. 
    Miss Shào is an experienced consultant, and will be responsible for monitoring your work.
    Make sure you don't miss anything!
