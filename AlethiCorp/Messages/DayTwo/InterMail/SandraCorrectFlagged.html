<p>Hi, FIRSTNAME</p>
<p>
    I see you managed to find some really suspicious pieces of information :). That's great. Some of our
    consultants let way too many things pass, if you ask me. I must confess that I wasn't expecting
    this case to lead anywhere interesting, so I'm pleasantly surprised.
</p>
<p>
    The information you flagged led our agents to a subversive student meeting, and several pieces
    of subversive literature have been seized! Great job. Keep up that kind of work, and you'll be
    a grade B in no time. All the new information has been made available to you. See if there
    is anything that merits further investigation.
</p>
<p>
    The investigation is being upgraded to grade B, so you will be reporting to Shào Jingfei
    from now on. I'm sure you two will get along fine. Miss Shào is an experienced consultant, and
    you are showing a lot of promise already :). 
</p>
<p>
    Furthermore, there is a journalist doing a report on subversive tendencies in the Cambridge
    academic community, and our client feels that this might uncover some useful information.
    Information regarding this individual has been added as well.
