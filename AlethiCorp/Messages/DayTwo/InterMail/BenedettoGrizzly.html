<p>Good morning, FIRSTNAME</p>
<p>
    It was great to see you yesterday! I think this is the first time anyone has ever brought a trained bear to a
    company potluck! People will be talking about this for a loooong time. You must tell me more about your hobby
    some day.
</p>
<p>
    I hope you will keep showing up for the social events, but don't feel obligated to do something
    big every time. The important thing is that we get to know each other!
</p>
<p>
    As for now, you should sign up for the onboarding event tomorrow morning. This is a great opportunity to meet
    the other recent employees, and learn about the history of the company! You don't need to bring anything but
    a cheerful mood and a sunny disposition. I'm afraid animals are not allowed :):):).
