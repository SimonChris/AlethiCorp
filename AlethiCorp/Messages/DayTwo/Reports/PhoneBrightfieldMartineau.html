<p><b>Martin:</b> Hello, Martin here.</p>
<p><b>Absolon:</b> Good morning, Mr. Brightfield. I hope I'm not interrupting?</p>
<p><b>Martin:</b> Not at all. Who is this?</p>
<p>
  <b>Absolon:</b> I'm Absolon Martineau, and I'm calling from the Global Health Foundation.
  Our records show that you're currently donating five pounds per month to support our health initiatives.
</p>
<p><b>Martin:</b> Yeah, I think that's right.</p>
<p>
  <b>Absolon:</b> We're deeply grateful for your contribution. Perhaps you have heard of the flu epidemic
  currently ravaging South America? If you could be convinced to raise your contribution to ten
  pounds, we would be able to vaccinate one more child per month.
</p>
<p><b>Martin:</b> I'll have to think about it. I just published a book, so money is a bit tight right now.</p>
<p><b>Absolon:</b> I understand. Can I...</p>
<p><b>Martin:</b> I could send you a copy of my book, if you would like. I would love some feedback!</p>
<p><b>Absolon:</b> I'm not sure...</p>
<p>
  <b>Martin:</b> It's about a group of people who decide to start their own society, and learn from
  the mistakes of the past. I think you might like it. What's your address?
</p>
<p><b>Absolon:</b> I'll call you back later.</p>
