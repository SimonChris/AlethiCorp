<p>Hello, Cédric. </p>
<p>
  I hope you're doing well at Cambridge. When you've written something, could you sent it my way
  so I can look it over? It doesn't have to be anything substantial. Just a rough draft of
  how the article is going to look would be great.

  Hi, Veli. Sure, I'll send you something later today. I haven't really found much material yet, but
  I suppose I can string some clichés together, and transfer the document.
  Will that be sufficient?
