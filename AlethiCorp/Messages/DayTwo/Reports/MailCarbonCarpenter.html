    Hi Silva. I’ve been thinking about our conversation, and I think I would like to join your
    group. My current group has no passion, and I love the idea of doing some more active
    stuff, in addition to studying. I’m not really sure about my political views, though. Do you
    think I could drop by for a few meetings, and see if it’s for me?

<p>Hi Pat!</p>
<p>
    Of course, you can drop by! We’re not some shady secret society or anything :). And don’t
    worry about politics. We pretty much disagree about everything as is! It’s not like you’ll be
    required to swear an oath on Das Kapital or anything :). As long as you’d like to fight social
    injustice, it’s cool. Suppose I’ll see you on Friday, then?
