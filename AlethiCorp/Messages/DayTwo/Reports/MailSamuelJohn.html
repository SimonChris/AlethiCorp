    Dearest Sam, I just spoke to Martin, vis a vis his recently published novel.
    Quite frankly, I don’t think he has it in him to ever be a great writer, or even a particularly
    good one, at least not from a literary viewpoint. However, he seems to be enjoying himself,
    and I think he might make a decent hack writer someday. I’m just afraid he’ll by crushed by
    the reception of his novel. The basic story is a decent conspiracy yarn, but the execution is
    sorely lacking. With a good editor, and a few rewrites, I think it might find an audience. I
    just know that he won’t take my criticism seriously. He is convinced that my standards are
    just too high, I compare everything to Tolstoy, etc. Do you think you could talk to him?

    Hi, Dad, I was just thinking the same thing :). I think I like his book better than
    you do, but I definitely agree that it could use a rewrite. We’re going out to The Goose
    later, so I’ll talk to him then.
