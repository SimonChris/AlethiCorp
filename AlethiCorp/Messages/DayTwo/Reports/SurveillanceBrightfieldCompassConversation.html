    <b>Samuel</b>: …definitely read better books, but I think it shows promise. I liked
    your descriptions of the youtubian society.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Martin</b>: Thanks! It’s good to know I can always count on you for honest
    feedback.
</p>
<p><b>Samuel</b>: Of course! That’s what friends are for.</p>
<p>
    <b>Martin</b>: Your dad is great too, of course, but he is a bit too harsh sometimes.
    He is so used to studying great literature that he expects every book to be warrant piece.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Samuel</b>: He just has high standards. You’ll never improve if you are content to
    be a hack!
</p>
<p><b>Martin</b>: Ouch! *laughs* Do you think I should publish a second edition?</p>
<p>
    <b>Samuel</b>: Hmmm… If you make significant changes, it might be a good idea.
    How much distribution have you done so far?
</p>
<p>
    <b>Martin</b>: Well, the first edition is mostly with friends and family so far. It will cost
    a few quid to reprint, but I can handle it.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Samuel</b>: Up to you. I can’t promise I’ll be around to help you with it though. I
    promised Hannah we would travel Europe together this summer.
</p>
<p><b>Martin</b>: Cool! Will you get to drive the truck?</p>
<p>
    <b>Samuel</b>: Hell, no! Hey, notice how the guy at the next table keeps looking our
    way? Maybe it’s a fan!
</p>
<p>
    <b>Martin</b>: *laughs* I wish! Hey, over there! Why don’t you come over for a pint,
    instead of sitting there all by yourself?
