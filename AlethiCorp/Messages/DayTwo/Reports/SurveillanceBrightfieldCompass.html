    Agent arrived at pub “The Goose and Gridiron” at 17:30. Agent ordered a large draft beer<a href="#note">*</a>.
    Agent drank half of draft beer. Glass was now half full.

<p>
    The subjects arrived at 17:55, and
    sat down at a table at the opposite end of the room, because of course they did. Agent
    missed first part of conversation while attempting to discreetly move to a closer table.
</p>
<p>Second part of conversation filed separately.</p>
<p>
    Subjects noticed agent, and invited me to join the conversation! They even
    offered me a beer. Refusing would have been certain death. My only chance was to play
    along, and hope to placate their suspicions. My heart pounded in rhythm with the music as
    I sipped my beer, waiting for a chance to escape. Finally, it came. Two people got in a fight
    at the bar, and my companions were distracted. I mumbled an excuse, and left the
    building, as discreetly as a shadow moving through another, larger, shadow. A close call,
    but all part of the job.

    Agent left the premises at 18:25. Last part of conversation not recorded, as
    agent was distracted. Agent waited outside. Subjects appeared at 18:55, leaving the
    premises by bicycle. Agent attempted to follow, but car refused to start. Have put in
    request for new car<a href="#note1">**</a>.

    ** See requisition #AK-3498. Car should be the right colour this time. I wanted orange!
    They gave me lemon green.
