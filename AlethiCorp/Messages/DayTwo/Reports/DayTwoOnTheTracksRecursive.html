  Today, I'm apparently expected to review my own review of that book I reviewed yesterday.
  How delightfully recursive!<a href="#note">*</a>
</p>
<p>
  This review is a highly disturbing work of high-class subversion. The author leads
  with a quote from Emma Goldman, clearly demonstrating her subversive tendencies.
</p>
<p>
  The rest of the review deals with a subversive novel containing such
  outstanding criticism of our current society that it's a marvel the readers
  haven't destroyed capitalism already. 
</p>
<p>
  Instead of displaying proper moral outrage at this sinister sedition, the author of the review
  seems more occupied with analysing the perceived "flaws" of this pernicious work, clearly
  trying to distract the readers of the review from the imminent danger posed by the 
  author of the novel.
</p>
<p>
  The only logical conclusion is that this wicked woman is in cahoots with the author, helping
  him to undermine the very foundation of order upon which our prosperous society has been build.
  If they are not stopped, Atlas won't just shrug, he'll have a goddamn epileptic seizure!
</p>

<p>Recommendation: Stop this woman at all costs!</p>
