    In 1906, Emma Goldman started a journal. Known as “Mother Earth”,
    this journal would be a place of expression for anarchists and idealists of all types. During
    its history, Mother Earth would publish articles on a broad variety of topics, such as the
    labor movement, education, literature, government control, women’s emancipation, and
    sexual freedom.

<p>
    In 1915, Mother Earth became one of the earliest supporters of birth control,
    bringing Goldman into conflict with the Comstock law, which prohibited the dissemination
    of “obscene” materials, including birth control information.
</p>
<p>
    In 1917, Mother Earth openly called for its readers to disobey the laws on
    conscription and the military draft, as Goldman considered any war waged by capitalist
    governments to be illegitimate. As a result, Emma Goldman was tried under the Espionage
    Act, sentenced to two years in jail, and later deported. Mother Earth ceased publication.

<p>
    Throughout the history of the magazine, Goldman would continually champion
    the causes of social justice and equality, in all their forms. She never wavered, even in the
    face of persistent government persecution.
</p>
<p>
    What she did NOT do, however, was publish a wagonload of cliché radical
    pamphlets, whose pages read like haphazard excerpts from Baby’s First Radical Textbook.
    Look at this: “The university cannot be an ivory tower, far away from the society, removed 
    from the practical accomplishments of the Revolution. Democracy cannot consist solely of 
    elections that are nearly always fictitious and managed by rich landowners and professional 
    politicians. We should not allow the word 'democracy' to be utilised apologetically to 
    represent the dictatorship of the exploiting classes.”
</p>
<p>
    To call this bad writing would be an insult to the concept of writing. This is not
    writing at all. It’s stringing together cliches, like lights on a christmas tree.
</p>
<p>
    Compare this insipid nonsense to Emma Goldman in the first issue of Mother
    Earth: “Mother Earth will endeavor to attract and appeal to all those who oppose
    encroachment on public and individual life. It will appeal to those who strive for something
    higher, weary of the commonplace; to those who feel that stagnation is a deadweight on
    the firm and elastic step of progress; to those who breathe freely only in limitless space; to
    those who long for the tender shade of a new dawn for a humanity free from the dread of
    want, the dread of starvation in the face of mountains of riches. The Earth free for the free
    individual!”
</p>
<p>
    Now, that’s inspirational! Don’t just repeat what you’ve read. Write from the
    heart.
</p>
<p>
    Bizarrely, the pamphlet also contains a quote from Philip Larkin, on the
    difficulty of forming informed political opinions. One can only hope that this shows some
    degree of budding self-awareness in the author(s). With luck, he/she/they might stop
    writing pamphlets, and read a book instead.
</p>
<p>
    All this said, the pamphlet does seem to be advocating the use of violence in
    the pursuit of revolutionary goals. It’s hard to tell how much of this is the earnest opinion of
    the author(s), and how much is merely regurgitated from various left-wing sources, but it’s
    probably best not to take chances.
