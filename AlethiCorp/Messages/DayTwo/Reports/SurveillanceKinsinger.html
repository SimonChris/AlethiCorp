<p>Conversation overheard by agent in the hallway near the bathrooms.</p>
<p><b>Victor:</b> Excuse, me?</p>
<p><b>Cédric:</b> Yes? Can I help you?</p>
<p><b>Victor:</b> You're Cédric Kinsinger, right? OMG, I can't believe it's actually you!</p>
<p><b>Cédric:</b> Did you just say oh-em-gee out loud?</p>
<p><b>Victor:</b> Is that bad? I didn't mean to offend you.</p>
<p><b>Cédric:</b> Well, I wouldn't use that expression in an article...</p>
<p><b>Victor:</b> Oh, of course, I know that. My writing is very different from my use of colloquial language, I assure you.</p>
<p><b>Cédric:</b> That's good to hear.</p>
<p>
  <b>Victor:</b> The Iberostar report was mind-blowing! I'm studying history, but I hope to be an investigative journalist. Or an information consultant of some kind. Do you think I could get your autograph? I have a copy of your book at my room
  I could go get it right now!
</p>
<p><b>Cédric:</b> Sure... Listen, maybe you could do something for me?</p>
<p><b>Victor:</b> Of course! That would be awesome!</p>
<p>
  <b>Cédric:</b> I am writing a report on student visions of the future. Do you have some ideas about the future?
  Or know someone who does?
</p>
<p>
  <b>Victor:</b> Well, I think it would be great if the different unions combined into a global union, so things
  could be more organized. Is that the kind of stuff you're looking for?
</p>
<p>
  <b>Cédric:</b> Yes, that's very .... interesting. If you meet some other students with interesting ideas, could
  you let me know?
</p>
<p><b>Victor:</b> Sure, I can be, like, your deputy journalist! I'll go get the book. Hi, REDACTED, I didn't see you there.</p>
<p><b>Cédric:</b> Deputy journalist... How about you? Do you ... Hey where are you going?</p>

  Agent went to The Goose with Victor Marian to procure information<a href="#note">*</a>. Subject is cute, but did not
  reveal any useful information. However, subject did express sympathies with the views of Karl Marx. Further funding 
  is needed to pursue this avenue of investigation.
