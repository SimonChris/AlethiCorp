<p><b>Velika:</b> Velika.</p>
<p><b>Cédric:</b> Hi Veli, it's Cédric.</p>
<p><b>Velika:</b> Oh, Hi, Kinsey. How are things coming along with your article?</p>
<p><b>Cédric:</b> I wish you wouldn't call me that.</p>
<p><b>Velika:</b> Why? It's a name with a great history. Anyway, you didn't answer my question.</p>
<p>
  <b>Cédric:</b> I'm talking to some of the students, but I haven't really discovered anything interesting yet.
  No one seems to have any grand plans to change the world. Have you thought about my suggestions?
</p>
<p>
  <b>Velika:</b> Look, Cédric, I know you would prefer to do hard-hitting journalism all the time, but we have to
  keep the lights on around here. Not every story can be the next Iberostar.
</p>
<p><b>Cédric:</b> I know that, but I still think my suggestions are more appropriate.</p>
<p>
  <b>Velika:</b> Of course, and I'll definitely keep them in mind, but "the children are our future" is a
  great crowd-pleaser. Not quite on the same level as "won't someone think of the children?", but
  we've been milking that cow for too long.
</p>
<p><b>Cédric:</b> I'm not sure you can call them children. The girl I spoke to earlier was 19.</p>
<p><b>Velika:</b> And how many divorces had she been through?</p>
<p><b>Cédric:</b> I don't think...</p>
<p><b>Velika:</b> Children.</p>
<p><b>Cédric:</b> I'm just not sure what you expect me to find.</p>
<p>
  <b>Velika:</b> Just find me some students with visions, and write something about how the world will be different when they
  grow up. If you can find something slightly edgy, that's even better, but try not to get us in trouble
  with the authorities.
</p>
<p><b>Cédric:</b> Ok, I'll see what I can find.</p>
<p><b>Velika:</b> Excellent! I look forward to reading your draft. Later.</p>
