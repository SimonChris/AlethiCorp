    Agent arrived at the Golden Chip Fish Bar 30 minutes before scheduled arrival of subjects,
    at 18:00. Agent deemed it necessary to procure a sample of offered cuisine, to avoid
    arousing suspicion<a href="#note">*</a>. Quality was mediocre, but unsuspicious.

    cuisine<a href="#note1">**</a>.

    Agent looked out window at passing cars. Agent noticed blue cadillac that agent
    will never be able to afford. Jesus Christ, writing this way is exhausting. Who wrote this
    style manual? Anyway, nothing happened. Sorry.
