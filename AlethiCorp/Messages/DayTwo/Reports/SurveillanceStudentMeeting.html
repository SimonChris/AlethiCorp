<p><b>Present</b>: Alyona Artemieva, Alex Jaspers, Silva Carpenter, John Blue and Patricia Carbon.</p>
<p>
    <b>Alyona Artemieva</b>: *Bangs gavel*. Welcome, everyone. I know this room is a
    bit of a mess, but it’ll do. We’ll get our own place, once we’ve taken over the world<a href="#note">*</a>.
</p>
<p>*Sporadic laughter*</p>
<p>
    <b>Alyono Artemieva</b>: Also, we have a new member with us today. Say hello to
    Patricia.
</p>
<p><b>Patricia Carbon</b>: Just Pat is fine.</p>
<p><b>Silva Carpenter</b>: Hello, Pat.</p>
<p><b>John Blue</b>: Hi.</p>
<p><b>Alex Jaspers</b>: Welcome, Pat.</p>
<p>
    <b>Alyona Artemieva</b>: It’s great to see our little group growing. We need everyone
    we can get if we are to affect any significant social change. Why don’t you introduce
    yourself, Pat.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Patricia Carbon</b>: Well, most of you know me already. I’m a Philma student,
    along with Al and Alex. I’ve already met Silva, so I think you are the only one I don’t know.
</p>
<p><b>John Blue</b>: I’m John.</p>
<p><b>Pat</b>: Hi, John. What do you study?</p>
<p><b>John</b>: Lit.</p>
<p><b>Pat</b>: Cool. Nice suit.</p>
<p><b>John</b>: Thanks.</p>
<p>
    <b>Alyona</b>: Well, let’s get started. As philosophers we must strive to use
    philosophy to liberate the masses, and not just for self-indulgent navel-gazing.
</p>
<p><b>Silva</b>: You know I’m an igneous geologist, right?</p>
<p><b>Patricia</b>: That’s natural philosophy!</p>
<p>
    <b>Alyona</b>: Right… Anyway, Heidegger taught that we have a moral duty to teach
    the masses to live authentically, and rise above dull conformism. The basic political goals
    are quite simple.
</p>
<p><b>John</b>: Philip Larkin once wrote that…</p>
<p><b>Silva</b>: No one cares about Philip Larkin.</p>
<p>
    <b>Alyona</b>: As I was saying, the political goals are quite simple: To make the
    masses aware of their own potential. Once the working classes realise the power they
    posses, they will do the rest. Our job is to use our superior knowledge to enlighten them.
</p>
<p><b>Alex Jaspers</b>: Did the pamphlets arrive yet?</p>
<p>
    <b>Alyona</b>: I was getting to that! Pat, as our first step we have collectively written
    a pamphlet describing our views. I just got them from the printers this morning. Is someone
    outside? I’ve booked the room.
</p>
<p><b>Patricia</b>: I’ll check.</p>
<p>
    <b>Patricia</b>: There is this creepy guy skulking around in the hallway. He ran away
    before I got a chance to talk to him?
</p>
<p><b>Alyona</b>: Anyone we know? What did he look like?</p>
<p><b>Patricia</b>: Completely ridiculous. He was wearing a hat and sunglasses inside.</p>
<p>
    <b>Alyona</b>: Weird. Well, let’s wrap it up for tonight. We’ll discuss the pamphlet at
    the next meeting. We’ve all read it anyway.
</p>
<p><b>Patricia</b>: I haven’t</p>
<p><b>Alyona</b>: Oh, right. Wanna head out for a drink? I’ll tell you all about it.</p>
<p><b>Patricia</b>: Sure. Anyone else coming?</p>
<p><b>Silva</b>: Sorry, I’ve got a test on friday. I need to get home and study.</p>
<p><b>Alex</b>: I should probably get going too. I’m free this weekend, though.</p>
<p><b>John</b>: Night.</p>
<p><b>Alyona</b>: I guess it’s just the two of us. Let’s head out.</p>
