  Dear Miss Carpenter. I am Cédric Kinsinger. You have probably heard my name in connection with the
  Iberostar report. I'm writing you because I'm currently doing an article on the student
  communities at Cambridge, and your ideas for the future. After all, your generation are the future
  movers and shakers of the Pan-Eurasian Union, so by understanding your minds we can understand the future.
</p>
<p>
  I've been told that you're part of a student group that meets to discuss political matters. I was wondering
  if you had time for a brief interview? It would be a great way to get a wider audience for your ideas.
</p>

  Dear Mr. Kinsinger. Thanks for the offer, but I'm afraid you've been misinformed. It's true that I'm part
  of a student group, but we're just study mates. I suppose we discuss political philosophy on occasion, but
  mostly stuff we need to know for the exams.
</p>
<p>
  Also, your article sounds pretty lame, tbh. "By understanding your minds we can understand the future." Seriously?
  Aren't you supposed to be a famous journalist?

  Ha, you got me there. That line came from my editor, actually. She's a great editor, but not much of an
  independent writer. Are you sure you can't help me? All I have so far is a bunch of clichés. I could
  use some actual ideas to make this article less of a fluff piece. Do you know anyone I could talk to?
</p>

  I'll keep my ears to the ground, but I can't really think of anyone atm. Everyone wants a fancy consultancy
  position when they're done, so the last thing they want is to be associated with subversive ideas.
  Maybe you could write something about this kind of self-censorship?

  Hmm, maybe, but it's not what my editor wants right now. Thanks for your time, anyway.
  I'll keep looking.
