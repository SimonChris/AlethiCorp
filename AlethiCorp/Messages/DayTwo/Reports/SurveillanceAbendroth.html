    Agent waited at the rest stop near Stuttgart for subject to arrive. Agent had Big Mac with
    fries<a href="#note">*</a>. Big Mac called “Der Big Mac”.

    Subject left at 07:10 following the E41. Agent followed at a discreet
    distance. Agent ran out of gas near Dorfmark, and lost visual on subject. Someone should
    have let agent know that it takes like six fucking hours to drive from Stuttgart to Hamburg.
    What the hell?
