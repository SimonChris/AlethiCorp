<p><b>Present</b>: Alyona Artemieva, REDACTED, Silva Carpenter, REDACTED, REDACTED, REDACTED, Martin Brightfield and Patricia Carbon.</p>
<p>
  <b>Alyona Artemieva</b>: Good evening, and welcome to the meeting. I have some great news!
  We have even more new faces tonight. The growth of our little group is surpassing my
  wildest expectations!
</p>
<p>
  <b>Silva Carpenter</b>: This is getting ridiculous!
</p>
<p>
  <b>Alyona</b>: Why? New blood is a good thing. It prevents us from stagnating.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Silva</b>: Stagnating? We've only been doing this for a couple of weeks. And I was under
  the impression that we were supposed to be a tightly-knit group of close friends.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Patricia Carbon</b>: Come on, Silva. Can't we talk about this after the meeting?
</p>
<p>
  <b>Silva</b>: Sorry, but if we're not even going to pretend to be discreet, then I'm not
  interested. You'll have to excuse me. I have some basalt to attend to.
</p>
<p>
  <b>REDACTED</b>: I hope we aren't causing you problems?
</p>
<p>
  <b>Alyona</b>: No, don't worry. She'll come around. Everyone, this is REDACTED and REDACTED, both
  from the department of REDACTED. Also, Pat has brought her bf, who is a writer! Hi, Martin!
</p>
<p>
  <b>Martin Brightfield</b>: Hi! I am happy to be here.
</p>
<p>
  <b>REDACTED</b>: Hi, Martin!
</p>
<p>
  <b>Alyona</b>: Well, Alex is still training, and has anyone seen John? No? Well, I guess
  he's busy with a book or something. On the agenda for tonight is pamphlet distribution
  and discussion of Martin's book. Any questions? Yes, REDACTED?
</p>
<p>
  <b>REDACTED</b>: Well, I think the pamphlets and the book are great ideas, but shouldn't we
  be doing more? We're not going to change the world with words alone.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Alyona</b>: Well, we're only just getting started. Let's begin by getting our ideas out there, and
  then see what happens.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Martin</b>: Don't forget that the pen is mightier than the sword.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Patricia</b>: Well said!
</p>
<p>
  <b>REDACTED</b>: Well, I agree with REDACTED. I've read about this thing called propaganda of
  the deed, where you inspire other people by direct action!
</p>
<p>
  <b>REDACTED</b>: Yeah!
</p>
<p>
  <b>Alyona</b>: Ok... What kind of action did you have in mind?
</p>
<p>
  <b>REDACTED</b>: Well, you know that old statue of President Farkas in the courtyard? We should
  blow it up, to inspire people to question authority!
</p>
<p>
  <b>REDACTED</b>: Yeah!
</p>
<p>
  <b>Patricia</b>: How would that inspire people to do anything? No one cares about that statue.
</p>
<p>
  <b>REDACTED</b>: Well... It would remind them of the fallibility of authority.
</p>
<p>
  <b>REDACTED</b>: Yeah!
</p>
<p>
  <b>REDACTED</b>: I agree as well.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Alyona</b>: I think that's a bit of a stretch. Besides we are supposed to inspire people
  with our philosophical ideas, not with lame shit like that.
</p>
<p>
  <b>REDACTED</b>: But we are supposed to inspire them to take action, right? How can we expect
  people to take action if we are not willing to do so ourselves?
</p>
<p>
  <b>REDACTED</b>: Yeah!
</p>
<p>
  <b>REDACTED</b>: We must lead by example, not by words.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Martin</b>: I know I'm new here, but that doesn't sound like a very good example.
</p>
<p>
  <b>REDACTED</b>: I say we put it to a vote!
</p>
<p>
  <b>REDACTED</b>: Yeah!
</p>
<p>
  <b>REDACTED</b>: I vote for the vote as well.
</p>
<p>
  <b>REDACTED</b>: Me too.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Alyona</b>: Ok, let's have a vote then. All in favour of being stupid idiots? And opposed?
  Hmm. I guess it's four to three in favour.
</p>
<p>
  <b>REDACTED</b>: Yay! When do we get started!
</p>
<p>
  <b>Alyona</b>: Just wait a minute! We're not making a big decision like this with three members absent.
  I move that we postpone the vote to the next meeting. All in favour? Excellent. One third of the present
  members can vote to postpone a decision.
</p>
<p>
  <b>REDACTED</b>: Where does it say that?
</p>
<p>
  <b>Alyona</b>: Up here! I'm saying that! Meeting adjourned. Where the hell is that goddamned gavel?
</p>
<p>
  <b>Martin</b>: This wasn't really what I expected.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Patricia</b>: Sorry, it's not usually like that.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Alyona</b>: Yeah, don't worry, we'll sort things out next time. Maybe I should start
  listening to Silva.
