  "MAILSUBJECT" is an InterMail written by a newly started Associate Consultant, by the name of FIRSTNAME
  LASTNAME. FIRSTNAME clearly has an inflated sense of self-importance, and believes that I have
  nothing better to do than read mails all day.

<p>In the mail, FIRSTNAME writes: "MAILBODY"</p>

  It took me less than a minute to read this mail, yet I felt that it was too long. In that precious
  minute I could have read a page of world class literature, picked up another cup of coffee, or contemplated 
  the mysteries of existence. Instead, I wasted a priceless fragment of my life on this insipid collection 
  of platitudes. Nothing in the mail could conceivably be of interest to anyone, and by its very existence 
  the world grows more grey.

  P.S: You were probably expecting me to say something about Emma Goldman. Well, I won't!
  You don't deserve to have your name mentioned in the same paragraph as Emma Goldman. I won't even
  allow you to say "Hello, this is FIRSTNAME LASTNAME, do you have any books by Emma Goldman?".
  You should order anonymously, to show respect.

  P.P.S: My brilliant put–down above is a reference to a classic review by Roger Ebert, but I
  guess that means nothing to you. You probably don't even know who Roger Ebert was.
