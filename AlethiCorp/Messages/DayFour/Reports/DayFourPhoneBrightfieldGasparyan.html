<p><b>Martin Brightfield:</b> Hi, this is Martin.</p>
<p><b>Adroushan Gasparyan:</b> Hello. Is this Mr. Brightfield speaking?</p>
<p><b>Martin:</b> Yeah, that's me, but just call me Martin.</p>
<p>
  <b>Adroushan:</b> Very well, Martin. This is Adroushan Gasparyan from Melik-Baumgartner. You recall,
  we communicated a few days ago?
</p>
<p>
  <b>Martin:</b> Of course! It's great to finally talk to you. I tried to call you several times, but your secretary
  is impenetrable. Have you read my book?
</p>
<p>
  <b>Adroushan:</b> Well, I promised I would take a look at it, so I skimmed it yesterday. The basic plot
  does show some promise, but the writing needs a lot of work. As it is, we're not interested, but
  if you could polish it up a bit, I might be willing to give it another chance.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Martin:</b> That's amazing! I am actually working on a second edition as we speak. I know some literature
  experts, so tightening up the writing won't be a problem.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Adroushan:</b> That's good to hear. Resubmit it when you're ready, and I'll give it another look.
  Oh, one more thing. The current plot is a bit too subversive for our taste, but I think that's easily
  fixed. Young people nowadays don't want to burn down the establishment, and join hippie communes, or whatever.
  They want successful consultancy careers. Perhaps you could make it so that the main character
  fixes the problems of the flawed society instead of just leaving?
</p>
<p>
  <b>Martin:</b> I'm not sure... That's kind of a major change. The main character is supposed to liberate people.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Adroushan:</b> Of course, but Martin Heidegger demonstrated that most people are happiest living
  "inauthentic" lives as part of a group. What better way to liberate people than to help them live
  together as part of a strong society?
</p>
<p>
  <b>Martin:</b> Are you sure Heidegger said that? Maybe I should ask my gf. She knows that kind of stuff.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Adroushan:</b> Gee ef?
</p>
<p>
  <b>Martin:</b> Sorry, my girlfriend.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Adroushan:</b> Oh, sure, you do that. Just keep in mind that the plot will need to be restructured a bit, if you
  want us to publish your book.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Martin:</b> Ok, I'll figure it out. Thanks for calling!
</p>
<p>
  <b>Adroushan:</b> You're welcome.
