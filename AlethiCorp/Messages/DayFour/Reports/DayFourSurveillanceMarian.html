  It turned out that there was a flight to Paris the next morning! Tickets
  were expensive, but purchase was deemed necessary to win the trust of subject<a href="#note">*</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The flight departed from Heathrow at 07:30, and arrived at De Gaulle airport at 07:45.
  The city was just as beautiful as Agent had imagined. The sun was shining, and
  temperature was around 20°C. Agent and subject laughed together at our
  crazy spontaneity.
</p>
<p>
  Agent and subject had the best day ever, seeing the sights of Paris together, and
  trying several fancy restaurants<a href="#note1">**</a>. Subject is starting
  to open up, and hinted at knowing important subversives.
</p>
<p>
  In the evening, Agent and subject relaxed at the hotel together, and ordered
  room service<a href="#note2">***</a>. With sufficient amounts of expensive
  champagne, Agent got subject to open up, and discuss subversive topics, such
  as Emma Goldman, surplus value, and the Unabomber.
</p>
<p>
  Agent is close to a breakthrough. Subject has hinted at being able to introduce Agent
  to subversive Parisian groups. Agent ordered more expensive champagne, to get
  subject to let down his guard<a href="#note3">****</a>, but subject told
  Agent to be patient.
</p>
<p>
  Further funding is necessary to pursue this avenue of investigation.
