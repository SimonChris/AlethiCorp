<p><b>Present</b>: C17 and John Blue</p>
<p>
  <b>C17</b>: So, Mr. Blue, I'm afraid this is the end of your subversive career. How are you feeling?
</p>
<p>
  <b>John Blue</b>: I'm not sure... Kinda relieved, honestly. It was exciting to begin with, but I was starting to have
  second thoughts. Everything just seemed a bit too ... cliché, somehow.
</p>
<p>
  <b>C17</b>: That's good. Regret will look good on your record.
</p>
<p>
  <b>John Blue</b>: What's going to happen now? Are you going to torture me?
</p>
<p>
  <b>C17</b>: What? No, I'm not remotely qualified for anything like that.
</p>
<p>
  <b>John Blue</b>: That was a plural you!!!<a href="#note">*</a>
</p>
<p>
  <b>C17</b>: Oh, right. No, torture is rarely an effective option, and you don't strike
  me as the torturable type, anyway. Just cooperate and everything will be fine. You'll probably
  be resettled to a nice location. One of my former colleagues was sent to Portmeirion!
</p>
<p>
  <b>John Blue</b>: Ok...
</p>
<p>
  <b>C17</b>: But I digress. Tell me how you became involved with IAM operatives.
</p>
<p>
  <b>John Blue</b>: Well, I was going through a rough patch, and it just kinda happened...
  Philip Larkin once said that "you can look out of your life like a train and see what you're heading for, but you can't stop the train."
</p>
<p>
  <b>C17</b>: That's not a very good metaphor, though, is it? Trains run on tracks. You made a choice.
</p>
<p>
  <b>John Blue</b>: Maybe choices are like the railroad switches?
</p>
<p>
  <b>C17</b>: Please tell me this is not going to turn into a trolley problem.
</p>
<p>
  <b>John Blue</b>: God, no! I got sick of trolley problems halfway through Introduction to Philosophy. I guess that's why
  I switched to literature.
</p>
<p>
  <b>C17</b>: Well, Heidegger thought it was important for people to realize the necessity of making sacrifices for the greater good. I
  actually wrote my thesis on trolley problems. Ha ha, I guess this is one area where I really would be
  qualified to torture you! Sorry, was that in bad taste?
</p>
<p>
  <b>John Blue</b>: A bit... I guess you might have a point. Trains don't make for very good
  metaphors. Nothing else is quite like a train.
</p>
<p>
  <b>C17</b>: I don't know about that; this conversation seems to have gone off the rails a while ago.
  Let's try to stay on topic: Once you had joined IAM, you infiltrated a student society, and turned
  it towards subversive purposes. Correct?
</p>
<p>
  <b>John Blue</b>: Not really. I guess I joined the group for the same reason I joined IAM, but
  the two things didn't have much to do with each other. Anyway, the others didn't really pay much
  attention to me. I am not very good with meetings.
</p>
<p>
  <b>C17</b>: Our intelligence indicates that you had a greater influence than you seem to think.
  It's in you own best interest not to hold anything back. So, after infiltrating the society, you
  participated in the subversion of the Cédric Kinsinger. Correct?
</p>
<p>
  <b>John Blue</b>: I contacted him a few times, but he didn't seem like he had any idea what I was
  talking about. The others said it was due to "plausible deniability"<a href="#note1">**</a>, but I honestly think they were
  full of shit. I'm not sure that IAM ever...
</p>
<p>
  <b>C17</b>: Don't speculate. Just answer the questions. We're much better qualified to analyze information
  than you.
</p>
<p>
  <b>John Blue</b>: But you're only asking yes/no questions. Do you just want me to answer "yes" to
  everything?
</p>
<p>
  <b>C17</b>: No, We'll need you to sign a statement too, but I am happy to hear that you're willing to cooperate.
  Let's call it a day, and I'll draw up the paperwork.
