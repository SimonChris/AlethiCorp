<p>Hi, FIRSTNAME.</p>
<p>
  It seems that you have some talent for Information Management. I've looked through the case reports, and your analysis has
  produced a few results. There is certainly room for improvement, but you still seem to be learning quickly.
</p>
<p>
  Anyway, I think we should have a meeting, so I can give you some pointers. Given that this is England, we should have a cup of tea together sometime, and
  I know just the recipe to add spice to the occasion: Shortbread, with a light, buttery taste!
</p>
<p>
  You dice some butter and sift over flour, caster sugar, salt and vanilla extract. Form the mixture into a ball, roll out the shortbread on a lightly floured
  surface, and cut into strips. Lay the biscuits on a greased baking sheet, prick the surfaces with a fork, and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Sprinkle sugar
  on the shortbread and bake for 8 minutes at 180C. Let them cool, and dust with caster sugar before serving with lemon posset. I can't wait
  to see your face when you taste them!
</p>
<p>
  As you may have noticed, the investigation is currently "drawing to a close". What this means is that management is getting impatient, and would
  like to see results. I have looked through the reports, and I think we have more than enough data to start making recommendations. Therefore, I
  have given you access to the Recommendations section. Making recommendations is easy as pie: Simply fill out all fields correctly and
  click 'Create'.
</p>
<p>
  Please make a recommendation for each person whom you feel is sufficiently suspicious to
  merit one. Your recommendations will be used to wrap up the case, so make sure you don't miss anything!
</p>
<p>
  I look forward to reading your conclusions!
