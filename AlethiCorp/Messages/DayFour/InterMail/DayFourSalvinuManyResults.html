<p>Hi, FIRSTNAME.</p>
<p>
  It seems that you have a real talent for Information Management. I've looked through the case reports, and your analysis has
  produced lots of results. I am happy to be working with you. I am sure we can learn a lot from each other :).
</p>
<p>
  Anyway, I think your success calls for a celebration. Given that this is England, we should have a cup of tea together sometime, and
  I know just the recipe to add spice to the occasion: Triple decker scones with fresh fruit!
</p>
<p>
  You stir sugar into a flour mixture, and add a milky egg mixture to the flour, stirring gently until you have soft dough. Flatten
  the dough on a floured surface, and cut out the scones with a circular cutter. Arrange the scones on the prepared baking sheets, and
  bake for 10-15 minutes at 220°C, until golden. Cut each scone in half, put whipped cream on the bottom half, and cover with raspberries and blueberries.
  Cut the lower side off another bottom half, put the cut scone on top of the cream, and layer again with cream and fruit. Finish by adding
  the top half of the scone.

  As you may have noticed, the investigation is currently "drawing to a close". What this means is that management is getting impatient, and would
  like to see results. I have looked through the reports, and I think we have more than enough data to start making recommendations. Therefore, I
  have given you access to the Recommendations section. Making recommendations is easy as pie: Simply fill out all fields correctly and 
  click 'Create'.
</p>
<p>
  Please make a recommendation for each person whom you feel is sufficiently suspicious to
  merit one. Your recommendations will be used to wrap up the case.
</p>
<p>
  I look forward to reading your conclusions!
