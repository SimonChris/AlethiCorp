<p>Hi, FIRSTNAME</p>
<p>
  It was great to see you at the club night! You looked adorable dancing with DANCEPARTNER :).
  I am glad to see that you have decided prioritize social events. Getting to know
  your colleagues in an informal venue is a great way to increase synergy.
</p>
<p>
  However, I was bit disappointed that you didn't sign up for any particular drink. Seeing
  what people come up with is half the fun of these things :). A generic round of whatever
  you like just isn't the same. For a good consultant, imagination is just as important as logic.

  There are no more social events this week, but you'll have more opportunities for fun soon enough.
  Make sure you prioritize them, and see them as an opportunity to exercise your imagination :).
