  Good to hear from you, FIRSTNAME. I'm sorry you didn't manage to follow my instructions.
  I guess they were a bit too complicated for someone so inexperienced.
  However, I am sure you will manage to make yourself useful, somehow :).

  For now, you should focus on making your recommendations. Make sure you make the right ones ;).
