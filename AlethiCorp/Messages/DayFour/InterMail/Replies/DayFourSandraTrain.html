  Hi, FIRSTNAME.
</p>
<p>
  Good to hear from you! I am glad that you share my interest in trains. Trains make for great metaphors
  because a train journey reminds us of life itself. Do we not all sometimes feel that we are just
  moving along predetermined tracks, towards an unknown destination?
</p>

  You should read "The Whitsun Wedding", by Philip Larkin, in which a train journey through
  the English countryside becomes a metaphor for transition and renewal. That's probably
  one of my favourite poems ever :).
</p>
<p>
  As long as you stay on the right track, you will soon reach the end of the line :).
