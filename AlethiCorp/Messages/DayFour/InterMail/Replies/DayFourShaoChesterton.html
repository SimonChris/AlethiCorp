  Thanks for your invaluable input, but I'm pretty sure I know more about Chesterton than you.
  Have you even read the Jeeves and Wooster stories?

  I would love to get together, and discuss literature some day, but for now I think
  we should both focus on the case. Once these dangerous subversives have been
  caught, there will be more time for the pleasures of the intellect :).
