  Hi, FIRSTNAME.
</p>
<p>
  It's good to hear from you. However, I am no longer directly managing your case. If you have questions, you
  should talk to Sal or Ling. I am sure they will be happy to help you :).
</p>
<p>
  I understand that you are about to make your final recommendations? I almost envy you :).
  Making recommendations is my favourite part of this job. It's great to know that your
  opinions actually matter, and can help make the world a better place :).
</p>
<p>
  I look forward to seeing the results of your investigation!
