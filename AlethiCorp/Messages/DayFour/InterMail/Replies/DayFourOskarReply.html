<p>Hello, FIRSTNAME.</p>
<p>
  I am sure that your mail must seem incredibly important to your inexperienced mind.
</p>
<p>
  However, as a managing consultant, I operate on a completely different level of importance. The kind
  of stuff that is worthy of my attention would never be entrusted to one such as you. Thus, I can 
  safely assume that your message is not at my level.
</p>
<p>
  If you work hard, you may one day advance to a grade where people such as myself may actually
  listen to your advice.
