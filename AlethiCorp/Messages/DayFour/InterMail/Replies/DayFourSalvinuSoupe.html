<p>Hi, FIRSTNAME.</p>
<p>
  It's good to hear from you, and I am happy to hear that you liked my recipe! I can't wait to exchange recipes with you :).
  Trust me, I know recipes for things so delicious they make soupe l'oignon taste like gruel.

  Right now, however, we have to wrap up this case. Management expects to see results, so let's show those
  subversives they can't pull the wool over the eyes of a good consultant. Well, they can, but we will
  pull it right back off!

  Once this thing is done, there will be more time to discuss food. And cook it. And eat it.
  And then cook it again. And eat it again. But that's it. You have to take care of
  your body.
