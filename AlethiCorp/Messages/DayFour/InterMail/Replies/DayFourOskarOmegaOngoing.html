<p>Thanks for keeping me up to date with this.</p>

  As I said earlier, the important thing is not to let the hackers know we are on to them. The slightest misstep
  could spook them, and we might never get an opportunity like this again.
</p>
<p>
  Therefore, I am authorising you to do whatever the hackers want you to do, and whatever you feel is necessary
  to win their trust. Don't worry about causing any damage. I will intercept your input from my
  side and make sure that no harm is done. They will just think that I managed to spoil their plans, in spite
  of your excellent work.
</p>
<p>
  Once again, Good luck!
