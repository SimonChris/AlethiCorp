<p>Dear Mr. LASTNAME</p>

<p>I see that you have attempted to contact me several times before.</p>
<p>
  Normally, I don't communicate directly with associates, but I admire
  your persistence. As I write in my book: "Persistence is the first step
  towards synergy."
</p>
<p>
  If you keep trying to accomplish great things, you will eventually go far.
  You may never quite reach the stars, but you might be able to go as far as
  Mars, or maybe even Saturn. Metaphorically speaking, of course. 
</p>
<p>
  I will ensure that a copy of my book is sent to your address.
</p>
