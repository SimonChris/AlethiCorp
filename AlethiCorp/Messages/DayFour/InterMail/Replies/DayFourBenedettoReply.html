  It's great to hear from you, FIRSTNAME! However, I am afraid we are all way too busy wrapping up the case to stop and chat :).
  Why, I don't even have time to arrange any social events tonight!

  You should focus on making your recommendations. Make sure you make the right ones :). Once we have this case
  in the bag, there will be more time for fun!
