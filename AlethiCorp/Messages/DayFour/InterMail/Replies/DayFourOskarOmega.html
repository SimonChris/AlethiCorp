<p>Holy shit, thanks for bringing this to my attention!</p>
<p>
  Most reports I get are just people being paranoid about random website malfunctions, but you seem to have stumbled
  upon a genuine IAM conspiracy for once! It looks like this isn't the first mail you've received from them, though. Why
  didn't you contact me right away?
</p>
<p>
  Oh, well, the important thing now is to keep cool, and not let them know that we're on to them. I could block them from the site, but
  that would mean losing out on a golden opportunity to advance both our careers. You need to play along and
  make them believe that you're on their side.

  Therefore, I am authorising you to do whatever the hackers want you to do, and whatever you feel is necessary
  to win their trust. Don't worry about causing any damage. I will intercept your input from my
  side and make sure that no harm is done. They will just think that I managed to spoil their plans, in spite
  of your excellent work.

  IAM operatives always work in pairs, with an experienced "Omega" mentoring a less experienced "Alpha". You will probably
  have contact with both of them, but pay special attention to the "Omega". He/She is bound to be the most dangerous.

  I hope you are up for this. Good luck!
