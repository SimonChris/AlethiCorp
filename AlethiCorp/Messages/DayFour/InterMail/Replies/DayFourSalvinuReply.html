<p>Hi, FIRSTNAME.</p>
<p>
  It's good to hear from you, and I would love to talk some more. I always appreciate a good debate.
</p>
<p>
  Right now, however, we have to wrap up this case. Management expects to see results, so let's show those
  subversives they can't pull the wool over the eyes of a good consultant. Well, they can, but we will
  pull it right back off!
</p>
<p>
  Once this thing is done, there will be more time to talk about other matters. We can discuss your
  points then.
