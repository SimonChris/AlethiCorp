<p>Holy shit, FIRSTNAME</p>
<p>
  It was great to see you at the club night! I think this is the first time anyone has ever brought a trained bear to a
  club! People will be talking about this for a loooong time. You must tell me more about your hobby
  some day. Don't worry about the mauling, I'm not mad at you :). We'll just write it up as a company
  expense.

<p>
  I hope you will keep showing up for the social events, but don't feel obligated to do something
  big every time. The important thing is that we get to know each other!

  There are no more social events this week, but you'll have more opportunities for fun soon enough.
  Make sure you prioritize them, and see them as an opportunity to exercise your imagination :).
