<p>Seriously, FIRSTNAME, this is getting a bit out of hand!</p>
<p>
  I told you to stop bringing your bear to all the events, yet there it was! 
  The first and second times were fun surprises, but now I just feel like you are ignoring
  my instructions. We'll write up the mauling as a company expense, but this seriously needs
  to stop. If you bring your bear to any more events, I'll have to take it up with Sandra and Vita.
</p>
<p>
  I hope you will keep showing up for the social events, but try to tone it down a bit, OK?
  You don't need to do big things to impress people. We just want you to be yourself :).

  There are no more social events this week, but you'll have more opportunities for fun soon enough.
  Make sure you prioritize them :).
