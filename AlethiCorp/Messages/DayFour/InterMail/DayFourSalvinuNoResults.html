<p>Hi, FIRSTNAME.</p>
<p>
  It doesn't seem like your analysis yesterday has produced any useful results. I must confess that I'm a bit disappointed. You
  struck me as a GENDERREF with a knack for Information Management. Don't worry about it. I will be happy to help you improve.
  I still believe you have the potential to become a great consultant.
</p>
<p>
  Anyway, I think we should meet, so we can discuss how you can improve. Given that this is England, we should have a cup of tea together sometime, and
  I know just the recipe to add spice to the occasion: Biscuits!
</p>
<p>
  You mix spelt flour, butter, golden linseeds, pumpkin seeds, black sesame seeds, and sunflower seeds in a large bowl. Add water, and form a dough with your hands.
  Use a rolling pin to roll the dough out on a lightly floured surface. Cut into rounds, transfer to the lined bake tray, and bake for 10 minutes, until crisp, and 
  lightly golden brown. I'm sure we will have a lovely evening :).

  As you may have noticed, the investigation is currently "drawing to a close". What this means is that management is getting impatient, and would
  like to see results. I have looked through the reports, and I think we have more than enough data to start making recommendations. Therefore, I
  have given you access to the Recommendations section. Please make a recommendation for each person whom you feel is sufficiently suspicious to
  merit one. Your recommendations will be used to wrap up the case, so try to do a better job this time. I expect to see results.
</p>
<p>
  I look forward to reading your conclusions!
