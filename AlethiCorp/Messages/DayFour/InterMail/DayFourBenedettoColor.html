<p>Hi, FIRSTNAME</p>
<p>
  It was great to see you at the club night! You looked adorable dancing with DANCEPARTNER :).
  I am glad to see that you have decided prioritise social events. Getting to know
  your colleagues in an informal venue is a great way to increase synergy.
</p>
<p>
  Also, we all loved what you bought when it was your turn :). I've had white russians, and I've had 
  black russians, but I've never had a FAVORITECOLOR russian before! You will simply have to give me
  the recipe later. I am glad you are using these events 
  as an opportunity to exercise your imagination. For a good consultant, imagination is just as important as logic.

  There are no more social events this week, but you'll have more opportunities for fun soon enough.
  Make sure you prioritize them, and see them as an opportunity to exercise your imagination :).
