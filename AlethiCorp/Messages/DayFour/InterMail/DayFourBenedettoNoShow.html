<p>Hi, FIRSTNAME</p>
<p>
  We all missed you at the club night! These things are not mandatory, of course, but getting to know
  your colleagues is very important to ensure that you have a happy career, as well as to improve synergy.
</p>
<p>
  Besides, you need to unwind and have fun sometimes. As an HR guy, it's my job to make sure
  that you don't wear yourself out :). Remember, all work and no play makes FIRSTNAME
  a dull GENDERREF. You missed out on much merriment, yesterday. We all tried some
  marvellous new drinks, and Vita and Sandra looked adorable dancing together.
</p>
<p>
  There are no more social events this week, but you'll have more opportunities for fun soon enough.
  Make sure you prioritize them :).
