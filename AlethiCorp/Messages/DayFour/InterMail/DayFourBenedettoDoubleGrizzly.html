<p>Oh, FIRSTNAME, you're a rascal!</p>
<p>
  I told you not to bring your bear to the next event, yet there it was! I don't think anyone saw that coming.
  I think this is the first time anyone has ever brought a trained bear to a
  club! People will be talking about this for a loooong time. Don't worry about the mauling, I'm not mad at you :). 
  We'll just write it up as a company expense.
</p>
<p>
  I hope you will keep showing up for the social events, but don't feel obligated to do something
  big every time. The important thing is that we get to know each other!

  Oh, and you really shouldn't bring the bear to the next event. I'm serious this time. It's fun
  the first few times, but I think it's going to become inconvenient in the long term :).
</p>
<p>
  There are no more social events this week, but you'll have more opportunities for fun soon enough.
  Make sure you prioritize them :).
